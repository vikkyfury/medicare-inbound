Do you offer overnight boarding for dogs? Yes, you do, ma'am. And do you have a room for new patients or new bog Just coming weekend. This weekend? Yes. Let me see. Do you have dates for me? Yes. So it would be the [DATE] through the [DATE]. Yes, it looks like we have room. But we will have to do an evaluation and we also will have to have you make a profile for your pup. Okay, so if you go to the [ORGANIZATION] website, you're going to hit book now and you're going to create an account for your pup and you're going to upload their vaccines and there's a health care agree that we need to to sign and then after that we can get you set up for that evaluation. Okay, and how much is it per [DURATION] [DURATION]. So how it works, if you would pay for your you would pay for the room. So we have the option between luxury and classes. Our luxury suite are [MONEY_AMOUNT] and our Plic Sueets are [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then on top of that you would pay for play time. Okay, and how much is play time? So we have three play time options. We have our $[MONEY_AMOUNT] option which is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], so [DURATION] [DURATION] of play. And then we have a silver play time which is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. And you get extended checkout until [TIME] and then $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], which is our full care package, is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of stay, so [DURATION] [DURATION]. And you also receive a picture of your pup and you also get an extended checkout until [TIME] okay, and so if I'm getting back in town on Sunday, what time would I need to come pick her up? You just need to pick her out before [TIME] okay, so if I am coming into town to [LOCATION] and I just came to pick her up Monday morning instead, would I be charged like another [DURATION] [DURATION]? It depends what time on Monday you pick her up. Okay. Would I get a quote like once I fill it out on the website? Yeah, once you create that account, we can do a. We can make a reservation and at the end of that I can give you an estimate. Oay. And then you would like to that you just need to create the account. Okay, Ill ll go ahead and make an account. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Call back if you have any other questions. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I help you? Hi there. I want to go ahead and get a reservation down. I might need to modify it, but I want to go ahead and get it on the book. And my dog's name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what is your last name? My last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I just want to make sure I have the right one. No, absolutely. If there's another [PERSON_NAME], I would not want that. Okay, and what kind of reservation would you like? So it's going to be overnight for quite a [DURATION] [DURATION]. Not [DURATION], but overnight. And when were you looking to book? So I would drop her [DATE] [DATE], which is a Sunday, and I would pick her up on [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. Team. Okay, that has no problem. And could you remind me what's the most basic? I want to make sure she gets a ton of play time while I'm gone. That's always my goal. So what's the cheapest one for the overnight? Those packages, that would be our classic suite. Okay, can you. So sorry, can you. I forget I've done these things before. But can you explain again what they get with the basics? Yes, ma'am. So if you get the classic suite, you can still get a different package. The one that. Yes, it's more extensive, but they would get [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play. And that's the gold. Because with the bronze W is the cheapest one. They only get one play session. Ah, okay. Oh, no, that's okay. Okay, so classic is she gets the room. The classic is the. So aside from the play times, what's the classic itself? Then again, I always get this confused all the time. Yeah, that's just the room. It's just basic room. Okay. Oh, yeah, the other ones, they have like a patio or something. Is that right? Yes, ma'am. Okay. No, she's fine with the basic. Like get her classic. But then what is the difference in price for [DURATION] [DURATION] play versus one play, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Let me go back. Give me one second. No problem. Take the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I see he's been here before, correct? Yeah, many times. Okay. And I have even some credits on file, but they're the [DURATION] ones. So you're not the overnight. Sorry about that. No, take your time. I'm actually creating an online. So the silver, which they have the [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play for the group is [MONEY_AMOUNT] on top of the room and that's [DURATION] [DURATION]. So like the classics, we have two $[MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and that's per [DURATION]. And then the gold is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. But they get the extra potty break. They still get the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. Oh, to the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does still give [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION] and the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION]. But the [MONEY_AMOUNT] has a few other things, is that right? Yes, ma'am. [MONEY_AMOUNT] and those things. Sorry. Okay, go ahead. A progress report which is like pictures and updates on how their stay is. And that's about it. Okay. Okay, so. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] sil. That would probably be two. Okay, so if I did keep this for her to have all they play, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then real quick, less than the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. What's the price for the T [DURATION]? Two play times or one playime? So the one play time would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is there a [DURATION] [DURATION] times or. No, that would be the silver. Would they get [DURATION] [DURATION] play time or they can do [DURATION] [DURATION] play? It just. It depends. Oh, interesting. Okay, that's interesting. So basically if I was to do that, I'm looking at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], is that correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Oh my gosh. Adds up. And then if I want to add in the nail clippings, I can tell you that. Correct. Let me see if you want to add in a nail clipping. Trying to see did you want the [OCCUPATION]. Done? The nail trim? The actually might do the other one where they save it down really good. That would probably be the dremel. It's like where they rounded out. Okay. Yeah. How much is that one? That's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then, and then the clipp thing is how much? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Can you add that on there? Because I know for sure she needs your nails done. Yeah, of course. Did you want both of them or just a nail trim? So for the nail trim. It. It'it'it. Just makes they sharper. Is that what it is? They don't. They don't round it out? Yes, ma'am. They just clip them. They don't round them? No, you could do both. Go ahead and do [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then my other question is how much is it? If the. How much fe is it? If she were to do some lessons? Do you have any less? I don't know if I want to do that. But do you have any lessons there that get added on? Any specials to get added on since it's still expensive? Let me see. So they would still be the same, like the same price O It wouldn't like give a discount or anything. It would just add on to the total at the end. Oh, okay. Okay. And then could you tell me what vaccine she's still in need of? Yes, ma'am. I had brought in paperwork to show she had one that was still good [DURATION] [DURATION] from the [OCCUPATION], but I don't know yet what would be the case. Yeah, of course. Did you want her to have like a.m. and p.m. play times or [DURATION] [DURATION]? Oh, definitely the [DURATION] [DURATION], yeah. Okay. And did you want that every [DURATION]? Every other [DURATION] I would put it. Let's put it down right now for every [DURATION]. Because my goal is that she so socialized this long time because she. She goes there, you know, she's obviously in the cloud, she with them. The problem though is that at home she's least reactive when I take her on walk. But at next [DURATION], you know, she does okay. Sometimes they bring her to the side, but you know, she's been able to be there [DURATION] [DURATION] when it comes to the playtime. And that's my goal is like to use this [DURATION] [DURATION] or of. For whatever long it is for her to be with dogs like the whole time. And I hope is it's gonna help her. Oh, I understand that. Give me one second. I'm trying to see about lodging. Okay. Sorry, I'm trying to reservation so I can check everything outse. Yeah, no problem. And you wanted to check on the vaccine? Yeah. What? God forbid. I got there, they're like, oh, she needs this and that. And then I'm like flying. I'm literally flying to [LOCATION]. Yeah, no, they're showing that they're all up to date. The only one that is about to expire is the [DRUG], which expires on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Awesome. I wouldn't you to get that before. Yes, ma'am. Okay, so border to. Are you guys doing any of the vaccine. You know, you guys do the vaccine thing in the parking lot? Yeah, they'll be here on the [DATE] from [TIME] to [TIME]. Okay, let me write that out on. Is it Sunday? Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'm gonna put that in here or to tell a Vacine. That way I have it and it's all done. Okay, that's. That's all. You know what time they're there on the [DATE]? [TIME] to [TIME] awesome. Okay. Is there anything else that I need to know right now? You don't charge the card or anything yet, right? In case I want to change this. Okay. I just want to'in there if you know if there's any special that [DURATION]. Like, I know I didn't do this, but it was [EVENT], I think. Like, you buy a pie, apple pie, something like. Is there any specials going on while she's there? I do not believe so, no, ma'am. But I think I'KNOW more around the time that she's coming in. Okay, that's good to know. Okay. All right. This is great. Thank you so much. I'm glad that I'm down. And then I. I'll circle back on anything I need to change. Yes, ma'am. And I have her down for the [DATE] through the [DATE]. Yeah. So my question actually is if I pick her up. I've done this before. Like, when I picked her up on the. Like, say that that Friday more. They didn't charge me for that Friday. If I did it by a certain time, they just charge me through Thursday. What's that time again? [TIME]. [TIME]. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. At least'save some money. Awesome. Okay, well, thank you so very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. You have a wonderful [DURATION]. You as well. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi. I wouldn just check in and to see what it would be to get my two dogs on like a [DRUG] [DRUG]. [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]. Have we seen the pets before? Youve seen one of them, but not the other. Okay. What's your last [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME] is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and the pets name_cy and we kind of like. I know that she may not sure that she's up to date on shop there, but we've been going other places and so we're just trying to get them on this since we're going to be out camping and things like that. Okay, let me look here. So in order to dispense any meds, we do have to do like a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So that [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that we do prior to starting is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that would be just the exam and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], assuming that [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is current, which you said that you had elsewhere. And then medication wise. So there's a couple different options. There'a monthly chewable that will run. Let's see. So she's a lab, so probably around like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a [DURATION]. Now you can buy it on a monthly basis or you can get like [DURATION] [DURATION] at a time, [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. There is also an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for [DRUG] [DRUG] that covers for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. That one's a little bit. It costs about the same as doing like [DURATION] [DURATION] of the chewables, and it would kind of depend on how much they weighed. Okay. We'd probably do the twow of able. Okay. So I think she's around [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. So you're saying that the exam would be like [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [PERSON_NAME] and then like, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on how many months. If we got like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] worth of those. Is that what we're. Yeah. Is the othero [PERSON_NAME]? No, [PERSON_NAME] passed away. So this one is [PERSON_NAME]. So she is a [NATIONALITY] shepherd. She just turned [PERSON_AGE]. All right. Because I have a [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME], so I'll get that changed in our system as well. So yeah, it would be basically the exam, [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], and then the chewables. As long as you bring in like [DRUG] [DRUG] history. Okay. And I'll have to double check. I don't. I mean, I don't think [PERSON_NAME] is up on her [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. So what would that cost if we needed to get that done? I think the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay. All Right. O. So about. And that'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT] for both dogs for the exam and then the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and then the [DRUG]. Right. It'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the exam and the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. And then the [DRUG] would be additional. So, yeah, if you got like, let me look here because they're both probably the size range goes from [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm guessing they're both in there. So those are [MONEY_AMOUNT] per tablets. So per [DURATION]. Okay. Okay, perfect. Al rightty. Well, let me talk that over with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I'll let you guys know. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. || Good afternoon. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, is this [PERSON_NAME]? No, this is [PERSON_NAME]. O Hi [PERSON_NAME].

[PERSON_NAME] is here to see you as well. Because I'm sure she would love that. So I do have an opening coming up on [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. If that works for you. And I have an opening at [TIME]. Quick. Let me. Yeah, that one won't work. And then next [DURATION] I'm only in town Monday. Tuesday. Okay. Even the following [DURATION] is fine with me if [PERSON_NAME] has any openings. What about later on the Monday? What about a [TIME] [TIME]? No, Monday is a terrible [DURATION] for me. O okay. I have an opening. So [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] is here on Tuesday. What about Tuesday? I have a [TIME] on this [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. Correct. Is that our only opening that [DURATION]? Correct.AppleX because in between. So we have the [OCCUPATION] and then of course shel ll jump over to see her for everything else. Okay, and then do you guys just call [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and get my records and Stu. Yeah. So two things will happen. Number one, they are going to have you sign an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] release. I actually going to send you an email that will have our new patient forms in there and one of the forms is that [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] release that you have to give permission to do it or if you contact them directly, they will send them over if you you give them permission to do so. [PHONE_NUMBER]. I'm going to contact them directly to cancel this appointment. Why not? Anyway, perfect. And then can I give you our email so you can have them just send it to us? [PHONE_NUMBER]. Perfect. I saw yesterday told her she's going to have to start to get discounts to people. That's awesome. Ye. Go ahead. Okay.

Have a wonderful [DURATION]. Yes, you as well. Bye now. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I direct your call? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm a new person calling. I've never called you guys. I just looked you up in our insurance and I'm calling. Great. My son, we're actually building a house in [LOCATION]. We live in [LOCATION] right now. But my son is coming home from college and he called and asked me to make him an appointment for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But obviously he's not a patient. Ve so he's proably need an exam and whatnot. But he's only going to be here for the [DURATION] of the [DATE], and then he goes back to school for summer school. And I just want to know if you might have anything available while he's here the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. Well, he comes in on the [DATE], so he would have the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]. And he had two appointments. He needed a [OCCUPATION] and a [OCCUPATION] appointment for his ear. And I booked that at [TIME] on the [DATE]. But I can do anything else around that in the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. Sure, [PERSON_NAME], so we'd love to have you. We are booking out further than that, I think. But we can, if you like, put you on a waiting list and if something opens up, possibly get you sooner. Okay. What's your son's name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Is your name [PERSON_NAME]? I see it here on the caller idon y. I need to get you with our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Her name is [PERSON_NAME] and she'left for the [DURATION], but I can have her give you a call back, if that's okay. Sure. Our office opens again Monday, so [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], so we could get you in, get you verified, and get you on that next available list. And pop_ibly get an appointment that early, but it would just depend on a lot. Okay, well, what do you think the chances are? Not that good, because I might just like when he's home, you know, for the holidays or something, maybe start a new thing. But he really needs a [MEDICAL_PROCESS], so I only have that. Otherwise he's not going toa be home again till probably the fall, so. So let me get you over to [PERSON_NAME]. I think she's already left, but. Yeah, she's already left. Well, she can call me and if it works out fine. But I might, you know, I might still have to call around if he's on a waiting list, because I only have that Window of time that he's here. Want that date that he's here. Said it's the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. He's going to be here the [DATE], the [DATE] to [DATE] and [DATE] because you guys are not open on the weekends. Right? Right. Okay. And then he had another [OCCUPATION] appointment that he needed. So I have the one appointment booked on the [DATE] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. But I have anything before that, around that, after that and the rest of the [DURATION], [DATE] may open wide open for him to come anytime he can get in. Okay. I'm writing all this down to give to her. And then is he just needing in for the checkup and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or is there any like pain or any concerns and yeah, he doesn't have anything. He definitely hasn't been for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] since [MEDICAL_CONDITION] I'm sure being away at school he hasn't, but he has. Luckily we have a pretty. The genetics in our family are pretty good. I don't think are my kids have even had a [INJURY]. He had braces when he was in high school. Okay, so he just really wants the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is all he's asking for. I mean obviously I know he needs to exam but I mean that'what he. That's the purpose, not because he's having a problem. Okay. Just so [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and is F number the correct number to call you back on? Yeah. And then like I said, I found you guys in our insurance and we are [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. I know we have lots of patients with [ORGANIZATION]. If you have the subscriber ID and group number handy, I can take that down too. Maybe make. I can get it if you can hold on. I don't have it in front of me, but I can get it. Yeah, absolutely. I'll hold in my wallet. Actually, you know what? I think I don't have it exact because we don't get a card for that. It's under our blue closs per shield. So would it be the same number? I don't have a separate card for [OCCUPATION] for [DRUG]. You don't get a card for that. Okay. I think you look it up by I mean I can give you the employer. I mean when I do like the vision the same thing. We don't have a card for that. Usually when I have patients that have [DRUG], they log into their app to get the subscriber group number. I'm not sure that it's the same card as I don't use the app for it, but I do have. I mean, I do have an ID number for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] GroupW Shield and a group number and then the [OCCUPATION] coverages through that. You know, under that we don't have card I have for us. I'll take that down just in case it's a PPO. Okay, so the ID number, it's letters first. Okay, so [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Then [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay, so I have [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] no [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Perfect. Yep. And the group number is [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. What's after that? [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Correct. Okay, I'm going to give all this information to our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and then she can give you a call Monday when our office opens back up. [PERSON_NAME]. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Of course. Thank you."

I'm a new person calling. I've never called you guys. I just looked you up in our insurance and I'm calling. Great. My son, we're actually building a house in [LOCATION]. We live in [LOCATION] right now. But my son is coming home from college and he called and asked me to make him an appointment for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But obviously he's not a patient. Ve so he's proably need an exam and whatnot. But he's only going to be here for the [DURATION] of the [DATE], and then he goes back to school for summer school. And I just want to know if you might have anything available while he's here the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. Well, he comes in on the [DATE], so he would have the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]. And he had two appointments. He needed a [OCCUPATION] and a [OCCUPATION] appointment for his ear. And I booked that at [TIME] on the [DATE]. But I can do anything else around that in the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. Sure, [PERSON_NAME], so we'd love to have you. We are booking out further than that, I think.

Our office opens again Monday, so [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], so we could get you in, get you verified, and get you on that next available list. And pop_ibly get an appointment that early, but it would just depend on a lot. Okay, well, what do you think the chances are? Not that good, because I might just like when he's home, you know, for the holidays or something, maybe start a new thing. But he really needs a [MEDICAL_PROCESS], so I only have that. Otherwise he's not going toa be home again till probably the fall, so. So let me get you over to [PERSON_NAME]. I think she's already left, but. Yeah, she's already left. Well, she can call me and if it works out fine. But I might, you know, I might still have to call around if he's on a waiting list, because I only have that Window of time that he's here.

I had a tooth that was [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. It could not be saved and been curious about getting an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or a bridge. Yeah, most definitely. Y. Yeah, we can go ahead. We can even get you for a complimentary consult kind to do an evaluation, see what would be best treatment and then we can go over those benefits with you regarding the insurance, if that's something you're interested in, we can get that all taken care of. Even when you're in, we can kind of at least discuss the different options with you. Okay, so what I'll do is when I bring [PERSON_NAME] and I'll talk to guys about an appointment. I've already. I just had my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, so it's not going to. I'm not eligible for any of that. So it would have, you know, do something totally separate. Okay, perfect. Definitely. All right, well, we look forward to meeting you guys and seeing you. I will send an email with those that paperwork if you can please fill that out. And then when you guys do come in, just please bring your ID and insurance cards. Okay? Thank you so much. You're welcome. We'll see you then. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hi [PERSON_NAME], how are you? I'm good and yourself? Good. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] father and he has appointment on Wednesday here with [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. Y and my [MARITAL_STATUS] said that with my insurance was [MONEY_AMOUNT] with the copay and her mom just submitted insurance. Did you guys get that yet or no. Is it for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, yes, we have that on file. That's what we estimated the out of pocket for her appointment. Okay, so that might Is it mine or is it hers? Because she has two insurances. I show [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] as her only insurance on the file. Her mom just submitted one too. I don't know where if it goes to you guys or go to somewhere else. What insurance? What is the other insurance? Because I don't show anything submitted other than the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hers is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] too but it's through it was [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] but a she just submitted u I just called earlier and a lady sent sent me a link and she said she just finished it. Do you see anything? No. Look in here. Okay, there. It just popped up in there. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Let me see. Okay, quick question. What's your date of birth? Okay, so is there a court order stating whose insurance should be primary and who I'm primary first and then she's secondary. Okay. The courts told you that or. Yes, I got book out her. Okay, so your primary. Okay, I just want to make sure because typically it goes by birthday and her bir so I just don't want it to like deny and then what? I mean if it denies it then we'll just have to swap them around and resubmit the claim. But that's what we try to avoid doing. Okay, they'll have to put it back in the toolkit. Oh, we can't dual [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] because we can't put in the toolkit through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I'll leta know she can get the benefits but we can't really give you an exact estimate based off primary and secondary. We usually only do it off the primary and then kind of see what happens from there because we wont t know because we cant put it in the toolkit because [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have one so we can't put it online to figure it out. So I will let her know and she'll be in touch with you. About [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. I'll go by that because that's what they think first. Okay. Yeah. So. Right. Yeah. If there's any difference, we'll let you know afterwards. All right, Hu. Thank you. All rightty. Yep, I've got her new insurance attached on there. All right. Thank you, ma'am. Uh huh. You're welcome. Have a good day you. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hi. My just left and I actually wanted to schedule my daughter's appointments for her [MEDICAL_PROCESS] but I wanted to ask a question about her coverage. What was the question about the coverage? She said it would max out her plan if she got her filing address. But I'm wondering if it's like right on the borderline or like could you get some of the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] done? And she was a little bit confused about. That's Wait, I can't hear. Let me look at her financials really fast to see ``ah that does look like it might max out her insurance. Let me try to find her financials. Really so. Okay. And I'm just wondering because I see the front and back office we're going to be considered [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and restorative here. Are the [INJURY] or the [INJURY] [INJURY] not considered perventative? No, that is. Okay. That's the furive here. Okay. [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is only like [MEDICAL_PROCESS] ra while they're diagnostic but they consider those kind of a [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then everything else falls under either basic or major. Okay, I'm'm looking for. Her financials are really fast so I can. If she put anything in there. I see her. I think it's a financial summary that you guys have printed out now that I thought I can read it U Let me see. It's right here. Yeah. So it looks like the total fee for her [MEDICAL_PROCESS] was gonna be [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then her out of pocket was [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But yeah, it's like $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. So she'll be right on the max line of maxing out her insurance after [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. She has her annual plan benefits are only $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is that right? It might be [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. O okay. Paid benefits here to date. Is that what it is? I'm trying to figure this out. How much was her [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]? Was it $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]? Yes. For her [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Really [MEDICAL_PROCESS]? Yes. Wow. Okay. Okay. Wow'only $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Her benefit is only a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Yeah, they need to change that because she's paying an absorbitant amount every month for her denal and that's ridiculous if it only gives her a [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] aren't covered. I've never had a plan that cover [MEDICAL_PROCESS] because in a way it is [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. At least in [LOCATION] they can consider their [MEDICAL_PROCESS] because then you wouldn't get any more because you're not. But the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. You're not preventing decay. Well, no, but the craft ones would be. Yeah. Oh, I understand. This is all different. Yeah, this is all different down here. Okay, I'm gonna have to get her to call her [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] plan and figure out why they're charging her so much. Because she was supposed to have the premier plan. And if it's only giving her a [MONEY_AMOUNT], I don't know, there's like, a disconnector. I think her [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] isn't the greatest. Let me see. She has. She has point of service. So she doesn't have premier. She has a point of service. Pos. Yeah, and she was supposed to have the premier plan because that's when she signed up for. Okay, and her medical was screwed up, too. Yeah, I think so. Because her medical is already screwed up with her vision. Like, they didn't submit something or submit something. Right. So, okay, do you guys have. This is gonna sound really weird. She's in the process of trying to get a card from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Do you guys have her member number so we can call [OCCUPATION]. Me her social. Oh, it is. Okay. You did say that. I'm so sorry. That's right. Okay. Everything is so weird here. Okay, and then if we can't get it resolved with. Without the dental, can she just do, like, the one that's hurting her most? Yeah, absolutely. Okay, awesome. So we will give you a call back then and let you know. Yes, ma'am. Sounds good. Thank you so much. Have a good day. You too. Bye. Thanks. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hi, I'm calling to pay a bill.

They did adjust it. Yes, I see that. In [DATE_INTERVAL] this oay I would have to ask my [OCCUPATION]. And we're still honoring those.

This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I direct your call? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm a new person calling. I've never called you guys. I just looked you up in our insurance and I'm calling. Great. My son, we're actually building a house in [LOCATION]. We live in [LOCATION] right now. But my son is coming home from college and he called and asked me to make him an appointment for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But obviously he's not a patient. Ve so he's proably need an exam and whatnot. But he's only going to be here for the [DURATION] of the [DATE], and then he goes back to school for summer school. And I just want to know if you might have anything available while he's here the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. Well, he comes in on the [DATE], so he would have the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]. And he had two appointments. He needed a [OCCUPATION] and a [OCCUPATION] appointment for his ear. And I booked that at [TIME] on the [DATE]. But I can do anything else around that in the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. Sure, [PERSON_NAME], so we'd love to have you. We are booking out further than that, I think. But we can, if you like, put you on a waiting list and if something opens up, possibly get you sooner. Okay. What's your son's name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Is your name [PERSON_NAME]? I see it here on the caller idon y. I need to get you with our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Her name is [PERSON_NAME] and she'left for the [DURATION], but I can have her give you a call back, if that's okay. Sure. Our office opens again Monday, so [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], so we could get you in, get you verified, and get you on that next available list. And pop_ibly get an appointment that early, but it would just depend on a lot. Okay, well, what do you think the chances are? Not that good, because I might just like when he's home, you know, for the holidays or something, maybe start a new thing. But he really needs a [MEDICAL_PROCESS], so I only have that. Otherwise he's not going toa be home again till probably the fall, so. So let me get you over to [PERSON_NAME]. I think she's already left, but. Yeah, she's already left. Well, she can call me and if it works out fine. But I might, you know, I might still have to call around if he's on a waiting list, because I only have that Window of time that he's here. Want that date that he's here. Said it's the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. He's going to be here the [DATE], the [DATE] to [DATE] and [DATE] because you guys are not open on the weekends. Right? Right. Okay. And then he had another [OCCUPATION] appointment that he needed. So I have the one appointment booked on the [DATE] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. But I have anything before that, around that, after that and the rest of the [DURATION], [DATE] may open wide open for him to come anytime he can get in. Okay. I'm writing all this down to give to her. And then is he just needing in for the checkup and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or is there any like pain or any concerns and yeah, he doesn't have anything. He definitely hasn't been for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] since [MEDICAL_CONDITION] I'm sure being away at school he hasn't, but he has. Luckily we have a pretty. The genetics in our family are pretty good. I don't think are my kids have even had a [INJURY]. He had braces when he was in high school. Okay, so he just really wants the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is all he's asking for. I mean obviously I know he needs to exam but I mean that'what he. That's the purpose, not because he's having a problem. Okay. Just so [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and is F number the correct number to call you back on? Yeah. And then like I said, I found you guys in our insurance and we are [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. I know we have lots of patients with [ORGANIZATION]. If you have the subscriber ID and group number handy, I can take that down too. Maybe make. I can get it if you can hold on. I don't have it in front of me, but I can get it. Yeah, absolutely. I'll hold in my wallet. Actually, you know what? I think I don't have it exact because we don't get a card for that. It's under our blue closs per shield. So would it be the same number? I don't have a separate card for [OCCUPATION] for [DRUG]. You don't get a card for that. Okay. I think you look it up by I mean I can give you the employer. I mean when I do like the vision the same thing. We don't have a card for that. Usually when I have patients that have [DRUG], they log into their app to get the subscriber group number. I'm not sure that it's the same card as I don't use the app for it, but I do have. I mean, I do have an ID number for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] GroupW Shield and a group number and then the [OCCUPATION] coverages through that. You know, under that we don't have card I have for us. I'll take that down just in case it's a PPO. Okay, so the ID number, it's letters first. Okay, so [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Then [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay, so I have [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] no [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Perfect. Yep. And the group number is [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. What's after that? [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER].

I had a tooth that was [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. It could not be saved and been curious about getting an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or a bridge. Yeah, most definitely. Y. Yeah, we can go ahead. We can even get you for a complimentary consult kind to do an evaluation, see what would be best treatment and then we can go over those benefits with you regarding the insurance, if that's something you're interested in, we can get that all taken care of. Even when you're in, we can kind of at least discuss the different options with you. Okay, so what I'll do is when I bring [PERSON_NAME] and I'll talk to guys about an appointment. I've already. I just had my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, so it's not going to. I'm not eligible for any of that.

I received the flyer in the mail from you folks about a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] gift card for patients with insurance and so on. And I just wanted to see if you accepted the insurance that I do have. Okay. Who is your insurance through? It's. I see it's got two names for some reason. [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. DVH Denal PPO plan. We are in network with [ORGANIZATION]. Oh, okay, good. Yeah. And you said it was through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, that's what I said. That [ORGANIZATION]. I'm not sure who I took it out with, but whoever, I guess I'd like to make your appointment. Yes. Okay. All right. And you're wanting to establish here with us? Yes. Okay. All right. And how soon do you want to come in? Well, I mean I'm flexible. I'm [OCCUPATION]. I go to [LOCATION] [LOCATION] to take [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] days a week, Tuesday and Thursday. But other than that I can work in one whatever I like [TIME] [TIME], [TIME] [TIME] type appointments. But I'm flexible. Okay. All right, let's see. My soonest availability would be this [DATE], [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME]. I can't, I can't do Tuesdays and Thursdays because I've got a [TIME] point on top. Thursdays or I have an availability. You said [TIME] [TIME]? Yeah, [TIME] [TIME], [TIME] [TIME]. But I have more flexibility than that. I can come whenever I need to. If it's an issue. I also have an opportunity. [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. I have a [TIME] available. [TIME]? Well I, you know, that's the one [DURATION] I shouldn't do it. I've got a board meeting that [DURATION] and if they, if they determined to do any other procedures or anything, then maybe I shouldn't do it at that particular [DURATION]. Okay, not a problem. Sorry about that. No, that's okay. I. I have [DATE] [DATE] or Tuesdays and Thursdays don't work. The third I have, which is a Wednesday. I could do a [TIME], that would be fine. Okay, the [DATE] at [TIME]. Yeah. Okay, I'll write it down here. And what is your first name? First name is. Well I go by. My first name legally is [PERSON_NAME]. I go by my middle name of [PERSON_NAME]. Oay Rogerkay. I see the dental plans got both of those names. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what is your date of birth? Birthday? Yesterday. Yeah. And best contact number for you. Pardon me? Oh, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And did you have an email address that you would like me to put on file? Sure, and I'll spell that for you. And then you got our flyer. So bring that little paper in the flyer in withkay gift card. Sure. And we can get that for you. And what is your [ORGANIZATION] subscriber ID number? Let me see. It's got a policy number. Is that what you want? Y doesn't say ID number, just says policy. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay. Is there like a group number on there at all? There's not on the card, but you know, I might have the. I remember them sending me some email information that might have another number. Tell me to look quick. You can actually provide that? I'm going to send you some new patient forms. You can provide that us through that form and we'be able to know and find that information. Okay. I can find it here quickly if you want. Okay, sure. I think that's. They sent me all these numbers, pin numbers and I don't know. I know, right? Re. Like goodness [PERSON_NAME]. I thought it would be simple. Here. Huh. Tin personalized notification number, would that be it? Possibly. No. No. Well then I'm gonna have to try to find it. I won't hold you on the phone while I do it. Oh, if you've got documents you're going to send me to fill out, I'll get it filled out back to you. Yeah, I'll get that information to you. Sorry for the delay. Okay. No, that's totally fine. Not a problem. I haven't received my. I printed my card off and laminated it, but I haven't actually in the mail received my card. I just took this out in [DATE_INTERVAL], so. Okay. Probably just nil time getting it to me. So. Anywayah. Could be. It could be. Okay, so [PERSON_NAME], I've got your scheduled for [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME] [TIME]. [TIME] okay, now quick question. Sure. You're going toa do the obvious [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], [MEDICAL_PROCESS], [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and so on. I've got a one tooth that seems to be a little loose. I can't say it bothers me much, but it seems to be a little loose. So I don't know whether it's a crown that's loose or whether it's a tooth it's loose. I'm not sure what it is there. So if they look at that and they determine, for example that I have to have some work on it, let's say they have, they decide to just give it up and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], do you do that at the time or is that going to be another appointment? If the time is allotted, yes. We. Can we talk to you before we move forward with any treatment, obviously. But yes, if the time is allotted, we can definitely try to do it that same [DURATION]. And. Yeah, so typically it's just up to the patient. If time is available, we would. We could definitely do it. Where. Where is that tooth located? It's lower. Right. It's. I don't know numbers, but it's just past my front teet. It's just past my three or four teeth in the front. It's like the second one past that or something. I think I have [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] implants, but I don't think it's. I don't think it's one of the implants. I think it's a tooth in front of the implants. Okay. Hopefully it's not an implant. I hope not. I don't believe it. Yeah, I don't believe it is. I believe it's another two. Okay. All right. So I will put a note in there that you have that area. That is a little bit of a concern, but we'll do a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] where'be sure. Get photos and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] of all of your teeth and [OCCUPATION] will go over treatment then. I do have three [OCCUPATION] that [DURATION]. I have [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. And so either one of them you would see if you have a preference. If you know one and you have a preference. And we can. I don't. I don't know any of them. So they're all very. Probably no preference at all. That's what I like to hear. Wonderful dinner. Yeah, they're wonderful. They are. So I think this. This insurance, if I remember the way they explained it, it allows for. I don't have any [OCCUPATION] pay or anything on this type of an issue. They just pay you so much to do this. I think it's twice a year or something. Is that what your recollection is or do you know that? I just. I don't know at the top of my head. I. We deal with thousands of insurances. I'm sure you do. I couldn't tell you. Once I look it up, I will know more and I'll have a better breakdown. But we'll know at the time of your service. We'll have that done before you'll come in. Okay. All right. So I have. You are sending me something to fill out, are you? Send me. It will be sent via either email or a text message to do your new. Okay, great. Forms. Yeah, Great. Yeah. Great. I'll get them all. Sure. Yeah, you should get them shortly. They come over pretty quickly, so. Oay. Goodkay. All right, excellent. Well, we look forward to meeting you and we will see you in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DATE] [DATE], [TIME]. [TIME]. No, it's actually [DATE] [DATE]. Did I say [DATE_INTERVAL]? I'm in [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's what I have it on. Yeah. I was like, wait, hold on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. Okay. You're welcome. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME]. Have a good [DURATION]. ###e. || With [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], how may I help you? Yeah, hi, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME].

[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] in on [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. Can I help you? Hi, I would like to make a reservation for my two [NATIONALITY] Shepherd. All right, three [NATIONALITY] Shepherds. Just two. Sorry. So is this [PERSON_NAME]? I have [PERSON_NAME] in [PERSON_NAME] Black. Yes. All right. I pulled you up with this phone number that popped up. Okay, so looks like I'm just for policy, just checking their [MEDICAL_PROCESS] records here, make sure that they're current. And it looks like they are, with the exception of [MEDICAL_CONDITION], but it looks like we spoke to you about that. So when were you thinking of bringing them in, ma'am? I was hoping that you guys had availability for the weekend of [DATE] [DATE]. So [DATE], [DATE] [DATE], and then we picked them up on [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. So that'memorial [EVENT] [EVENT], they were kind of booked. Were you hoping to lodge them together? Yes, if I could with the last time we did do them together. Okay, so can you remind me those dates again? [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], picking up [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Okay. Unfortunatelyately, extra large suites, they're all booked at this time for the holiday. And we're running low on large suites for that weekend. That we could put them in maybe close by each other. We do have indoor indoor suites available. They're large, but they don't go out to the outside. They go into, like, another indoor area. And we can t put them nearby each other. But our large suites are completely booked for that weekend. I do apologize, miss. No, it's okay. You might want to try our [LOCATION] [LOCATION]. But if not, like I said, we can accommodate them in large suites individually. That would be fine. If they could be nearby each other, that'be okay. And then if I take for playtime, they cann't go out and have their own play time together. That way they could still see each other. Yeah, what we can do is book them so that they can go into an exercise run every [DURATION] outside and play together, like in a large exercise run. Or they can do doggy daycare where they play with other guests, like in a play group. But that's completely up to you. We can sign them up when you check them in. Okay. Yeah, they can't play with other dogs because they're still. They still kind of like. They kind of fight and bark and get a little rowdy. So I would just prefer if they could Just have their own exercise time alone to get the two of them together. Okay, so let me go ahead and make this the reservation here for us. And you said they would be. You said there would be outside, so. No, the suites that we have available left for the holiday weekend are indoor. Indoor, meaning that even though it's a similar size, the back of the kennel does not open up to like a patio like our other kennels. It kind of opens up into like a separate indoor area, unfortunately. Okay. But again, if we get them out to play once [DURATION] [DURATION], like in a large exercise run, they should be comfortable in there. Meaning that they'll get their outdoor fresh air and exercise together as a family. Perfect. That'll work. We'll have to do that. I'd rather just book it now because I kind of decided min to take a trip. So I'm glad you have something available. Sure. So [DATE] [DATE] is when you'drop them off and picking them up on the [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Yes. Okay. And we'go over those outdoor activities when you drop them off, including if you want to get them groomed as well that last [DURATION], depending on what time you plan to pick them up on some Monday. But you don't have to let us know now. We can discuss that when you check them in. If I could plan for that now because my [MARITAL_STATUS] will be dropping them off and I'm going to be at work and I already know he's going to be calling me and what should I do? And even though like how him want to do'll still be, I'd rather just make it to where he could drop them off and I've already taken care of everything. Okay. Do you want them to get out once [DURATION] [DURATION] or twice [DURATION] [DURATION] in that exercise run? Twice [DURATION] [DURATION] will be good. If you can remind me, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog or for twice [DURATION] [DURATION], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. It's going to be a little bit more. It'll be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog per [DURATION] and that includes a treat. I'm sorry, can you repeat that? Yes, it's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. [MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog per [DURATION] for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of play time. And that includes the treat and a late pickup time. Okay, so. And the late pick up time is an additional $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. No, no, it means you can pick them up after [TIME] on Sunday and you won't be charged for the [DURATION] like a hotel. I mean if you pick them up after [TIME] sometimes you'll be charged the additional [DURATION] because if You'taking up that kennel space. Okay. So yeah, we're going to just be doing. I'll do the exercise time on [DATE] [DATE] on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] or does it have to be on the last [DURATION]? You on the last [DURATION] too. So I'll go ahead and put you down for the full b. Do you know what time you'll be bringing them by on [DATE] [DATE]? We're hoping to be leaving by [TIME], so I'm thinking by like maybe [TIME] or [TIME]. My [MARITAL_STATUS] can get them. You're welcome to. Yeah, you're welcome to bring them in as early as [TIME]. Okay. So yeah, I'm thinking. Yeah, like it's like around like. Yeah, [TIME] [TIME], if not sooner. I'll have to double check with my [MARITAL_STATUS]. This is that going on that morning. So if I can just get [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of play on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] with them. And that's going to be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog, right? Yes. Okay. And then it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Being that we're using a different size pin, how much is it for [DURATION] per dog For [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]? It's again $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog per [DURATION] for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of playt time. For [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] it is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog per [DURATION] for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of playtime. Okay, but to kindnel them because last time they were talk together and I was just. Yeah, how much is that being that they'going to be in two separate pins? Because I just pay for the one pin. So for the kennel of the dog, the lodging, it is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for our suite. So for the two each is going to be $[MONEY_AMOUNT]? Yes ma'am. So I'm sorry, so it's not per. So it's not $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a plan. $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a pen. Okay, so again, the suite where the dogs are going to be staying, that's the boarding and lodging, that is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog. Because they're staying in separate suites. That's all we have left. And then if you want to sign them up for [DURATION] [DURATION] of play. [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of play. I'm sorry, that's $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog per [DURATION]. Got you. Okay, so if I can go ahead and just set it up, I guess we'do the [DURATION] [DURATION] of play for the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for each [DURATION]. So just for [DURATION] [DURATION]. So. So okay, so I'm sorry, I'm always confused things, but I just want to do [DURATION] [DURATION] of play and that will be on Saturday. So we'do the House [DURATION]. Okay. Oay, I got that. And that includes the treat. And you can let or you can tell your [MARITAL_STATUS] what to sign them up for. We have hot dog, ice cream or peanut butter. Okay, so $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for the reservation and we will see you and give you a call if we have any questions as the primary owner on [DATE] [DATE] when you drop them off. But I did sign them up for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of play time and an exercise suite on [DATE] [DATE] and we can add to this or subtract as needed. Okay. And then so that's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm sorry, please. I appreciate your patience. So it's going to be $[MONEY_AMOUNT] per [DURATION] for the lodging for the night. Yes, for the night. So it will be Friday night and Saturday night and then the daytime on Saturday is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of play. That's [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] per dog. Okay, thank you so much. I appciate if you picked them up before [TIME] on Sunday you won't pay for that last [DURATION]. It S a for the checkout is a certain time. If I picked them up before I. Yeah, the last bit of business is because it our extremely busy time of year and that's [EVENT] [EVENT], we're asking our wonderful customers to give us a deposit of $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And this deposit does go towards their checkout bill. So you'll get it back towards the end. Can I put that on your MasterCard ending in [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]? Yes. Okay. Thank you so very much. And yeah, I know it's kind of confusing just like a human hotel, all the different rates and stuff, but it does make sense once you kind of get to know it. Yeah. This is my second time doing it and being that the pins changed I was just kind of like wanting to make sure. That way I know how much is going to be taken out. But thank you so much for your patience and I'm probably going to more questions but I appreciate it. No, and I'm glad we're able to find some space for [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]. I do remember this family because of their names. Oh, awesome. Thank you so much for helping. Sure. And we'll see you on [DATE] [DATE]. I'm sorry, we'll see your [MARITAL_STATUS] on [DATE] [DATE].

Y and my [MARITAL_STATUS] said that with my insurance was [MONEY_AMOUNT] with the copay and her mom just submitted insurance. Did you guys get that yet or no. Is it for the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, yes, we have that on file. That's what we estimated the out of pocket for her appointment. Okay, so that might Is it mine or is it hers? Because she has two insurances. I show [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] as her only insurance on the file. Her mom just submitted one too. I don't know where if it goes to you guys or go to somewhere else. What insurance? What is the other insurance? Because I don't show anything submitted other than the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hers is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] too but it's through it was [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] but a she just submitted u I just called earlier and a lady sent sent me a link and she said she just finished it. Do you see anything? No. Look in here. Okay, there. It just popped up in there. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Let me see. Okay, quick question. What's your date of birth? Okay, so is there a court order stating whose insurance should be primary and who I'm primary first and then she's secondary. Okay. The courts told you that or. Yes, I got book out her. Okay, so your primary. Okay, I just want to make sure because typically it goes by birthday and her bir so I just don't want it to like deny and then what? I mean if it denies it then we'll just have to swap them around and resubmit the claim. But that's what we try to avoid doing. Okay, they'll have to put it back in the toolkit. Oh, we can't dual [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] because we can't put in the toolkit through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. I'll leta know she can get the benefits but we can't really give you an exact estimate based off primary and secondary. We usually only do it off the primary and then kind of see what happens from there because we wont t know because we cant put it in the toolkit because [ORGANIZATION] to [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] doesn't have one so we can't put it online to figure it out. So I will let her know and she'll be in touch with you. About [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Right. I'll go by that because that's what they think first. Okay. Yeah. So. Right. Yeah. If there's any difference, we'll let you know afterwards. All right, Hu. Thank you. All rightty. Yep, I've got her new insurance attached on there. All right. Thank you, ma'am. Uh huh. You're welcome. Have a good day you. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hi [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, I just moved to the [LOCATION] area recently and I wanted to talk about maybe becoming a patient and coming in for my a [DURATION] [DURATION] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and stuff like that. Absolutely. Let me be the first to welcome you. And how did you hear about our practice? I got something in the mail. We sent out some kind of a. It came in the mail like a solicitation fast? Yeah. Okay. And are you looking for something in the morning or the afternoon? Well, I've got a couple questions first. So I'm on Medicare and I have a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] Advantage supplemental plan. So anything. I just want to kind of get my bearings as to what I'm facing as far as out of pocket expenses. Just in general. I just don't want need big surprises when I come in. Sure, absolutely. So we work with all major PPO insurance companies as an out of network provider with [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] requires their patience to pay in full at time of service. We go ahead and we file the claim to maximize your benefits and then [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] sends you the reimbursement directly. And we do have many patients as you can imagine that you have the Medicare Advantage that come here. We've never had a problem getting reimbursement for them. So we could certainly help you with that. Okay, that sounds fine. So if I were to come in and I'd be coming in like I my teeth, I had my teeth looked at what you call it. I went to the [OCCUPATION] before I moved down here. So about [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. So I'be coming a training in an exam, right? Absolutely. You would be a new patient to us so we would have to get you established. So it would be the [MEDICAL_PROCESS], the exam. We would have to update your [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Unless you want to have what' called a full mouth set of [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] from your previous [OCCUPATION]. If they want to email it down, we can certainly use that as long as it of good diagnostic quality. Yes, we get you in for the exam, the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and the hygiene. What we would do is we would collect $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for the exam and the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and the hygiene for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that starts at [TIME]. So once we're able to assess everything, as long as a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] it would be the [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT] do so [MONEY_AMOUNT] that [DURATION]. Again we go ahead and we file the insurance for you and then [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] would send you the check. Okay. Okay. So two things. One is I could Reach out to my [OCCUPATION] and have them email you those [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. I could. Where would they send that to? What's the email address? I can give it. Perfect. It would. All right. And then my last question is, I am looking at this little card you sent me. We're going to call it. It does say about the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] and I get that. Then the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is on top of that. I get it. I just make sure here patients without insurance only. So am I missing something there or. Nope. And what we would do, the reason why we would do the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for you is because I believe that you would actually pay less paying $[MONEY_AMOUNT] out of pocket for the exam than what, what [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] would reimburse. And that's what we found. So that's why we collect the [MONEY_AMOUNT] do for the new patient and the exam and then we go ahead and we file that insurance claim for you. All right. I'm not missing something before I. All right, that sounds good. So yeah, if you try and make an appointment. Sure. Mornings, afternoons, what works best for you? I would say mid morning would work pretty good. All right, let's take a look. And would you prefer [DATE], [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME] or [TIME]? That's this [DURATION], right? Coming up, this next [DURATION] coming up. Yes, it's a Thursday. We could look at a different [DURATION] as well, if that doesn't sound like it. Yeah, kind hesitating. Let me just think about something right now. So yeah, maybe you wouldn't have it on Wednesday, would you? [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the [DURATION]. [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] there would be a [TIME] if that would work for you. Okay, let's do that. So Wednesday perect_m let me get a little bit of information. How do you spell your first name please? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Last name please? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Best phone number to reach you and best email address to send the new patient link for the forms too. Sure. All right, [PERSON_NAME], we look forward to meeting you on Wednesday, which is [DATE]. As long as your forms are filled out online in advance. Then we'll see right at [TIME]. If for some reason you don't have an opportunity to get to that, no worries. Just be here at [TIME]. Okay. All right, we got it. All right. The only other thing, [PERSON_NAME], we do ask that if an emergency should arise and you're unable to make this appointment, would you be able to give us [DURATION] [DURATION] notice to cancel? Okay, I will do that. Y All right. Fantastic. Anything else I can do for you today, sir? That's it. Thank you. All right. You have a wonderful [DURATION], [PERSON_NAME]. We will see you soon. Okay? Thank you very much. Bye. Thank you. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] to [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. This is [PERSON_NAME], may I help you?

Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] speaking. How may I help you? Hi, I'm looking for [OCCUPATION] for me and my kids. Okay. And you're from the area, so you're looking at scheduling an appointment with our clinic. Sorry, you're looking at scheduling an appointment to just become new patients. So [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and exam. Yes. Yeah. And you said it was for yourself and my three kids and my [MARITAL_STATUS]. Okay. And how old are you kids? [PERSON_AGE], [PERSON_AGE] and [PERSON_AGE]. Okay. And have you guys been seen by a dental office regularly? I'd see in the past [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yes. Yes. Perfect. So what we can look at scheduling appointments after that? There's just a form that I can send you via email authorizing your previous dental office to send us any [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that would have been taken in the last [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. That way we're not taking you [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] unnecessarily. Are you covered through a private insurance? Yes. Okay. So that way again, [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] are usually only covered every certain amount. So this would allow us to know what has been taken so that we're not taking anything that's not covered. Something I always just like to let somebody know ahead of time is that I can send your claim electronically to your insurance, although we still ask for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] amount [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] appointment at that time. And the insurance does reimburse yourself. Okay. Now as of now, I am looking into the summer for scheduling. Is it important for you to come all on the same [DURATION] or do you have different sk. It doesn't matter. I just want the earliest possible oay because my kids want to kill me right now. O We just, we moved to from [LOCATION] to [LOCATION], so it's been like [DURATION] [DURATION]. We haven't done any [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So we used to go like maybe every [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION]. Yeah. Let have a look.

Just because [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] amount of time it has to be one [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] two kids, the [PERSON_AGE] or the [PERSON_AGE] year old. Okay, so it's gonna be the [PERSON_AGE] year old. And are you gonna do everything like the whole like Y. What are you gonna do? Ye exam, [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Okay. Yeah, of course.

It's gonna be [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Yeah. Gum and. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Complet as a new patient we do a complete exam.

Up 3/4kay and then for the next appointment I would be looking at that been a cancellation that we have this coming Wednesday. So anybody's appointments that end up being too far out, we can always opt into a cancellation list as well. I would have another availability on [DATE], [DATE] and that would be for your [PERSON_AGE] year old. Yep. Can I just start with her first name? Forr [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] o Same last nameiallo. Yeah. [PERSON_NAME] Per Now I will also have some medical history forms that do need to be filled out prior to the appointment. Is it okay if I send those to you by text message or email afterwards? Email.

My name is [PERSON_NAME]. How may help you? Yes, good morning. I received the flyer in the mail from you folks about a $[MONEY_AMOUNT] gift card for patients with insurance and so on. And I just wanted to see if you accepted the insurance that I do have. Okay. Who is your insurance through? It's. I see it's got two names for some reason. [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. DVH Denal PPO plan. We are in network with [ORGANIZATION]. Oh, okay, good. Yeah. And you said it was through [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]? Yes, that's what I said. That [ORGANIZATION]. I'm not sure who I took it out with, but whoever, I guess I'd like to make your appointment. Yes. Okay. All right. And you're wanting to establish here with us? Yes. Okay. All right. And how soon do you want to come in? Well, I mean I'm flexible. I'm [OCCUPATION]. I go to [LOCATION] [LOCATION] to take [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] days a week, Tuesday and Thursday. But other than that I can work in one whatever I like [TIME] [TIME], [TIME] [TIME] type appointments. But I'm flexible. Okay. All right, let's see. My soonest availability would be this [DATE], [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME]. I can't, I can't do Tuesdays and Thursdays because I've got a [TIME] point on top. Thursdays or I have an availability. You said [TIME] [TIME]? Yeah, [TIME] [TIME], [TIME] [TIME]. But I have more flexibility than that. I can come whenever I need to. If it's an issue. I also have an opportunity. [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. I have a [TIME] available. [TIME]? Well I, you know, that's the one [DURATION] I shouldn't do it. I've got a board meeting that [DURATION] and if they, if they determined to do any other procedures or anything, then maybe I shouldn't do it at that particular [DURATION]. Okay, not a problem. Sorry about that. No, that's okay. I. I have [DATE] [DATE] or Tuesdays and Thursdays don't work. The third I have, which is a Wednesday. I could do a [TIME], that would be fine. Okay, the [DATE] at [TIME]. Yeah. Okay, I'll write it down here. And what is your first name? First name is. Well I go by. My first name legally is [PERSON_NAME]. I go by my middle name of [PERSON_NAME]. Oay Rogerkay. I see the dental plans got both of those names. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what is your date of birth? Birthday? Yesterday. Yeah. And best contact number for you. Pardon me? Oh, [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. And did you have an email address that you would like me to put on file? Sure, and I'll spell that for you. And then you got our flyer. So bring that little paper in the flyer in withkay gift card. Sure. And we can get that for you. And what is your [ORGANIZATION] subscriber ID number? Let me see. It's got a policy number. Is that what you want? Y doesn't say ID number, just says policy. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay. Is there like a group number on there at all? There's not on the card, but you know, I might have the. I remember them sending me some email information that might have another number. Tell me to look quick. You can actually provide that? I'm going to send you some new patient forms. You can provide that us through that form and we'be able to know and find that information. Okay. I can find it here quickly if you want. Okay, sure. I think that's. They sent me all these numbers, pin numbers and I don't know. I know, right? Re. Like goodness [PERSON_NAME]. I thought it would be simple. Here. Huh. Tin personalized notification number, would that be it? Possibly. No. No. Well then I'm gonna have to try to find it. I won't hold you on the phone while I do it. Oh, if you've got documents you're going to send me to fill out, I'll get it filled out back to you. Yeah, I'll get that information to you. Sorry for the delay. Okay. No, that's totally fine. Not a problem. I haven't received my. I printed my card off and laminated it, but I haven't actually in the mail received my card. I just took this out in [DATE_INTERVAL], so. Okay. Probably just nil time getting it to me. So. Anywayah. Could be. It could be. Okay, so [PERSON_NAME], I've got your scheduled for [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME] [TIME]. [TIME] okay, now quick question. Sure. You're going toa do the obvious [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], [MEDICAL_PROCESS], [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and so on. I've got a one tooth that seems to be a little loose. I can't say it bothers me much, but it seems to be a little loose. So I don't know whether it's a crown that's loose or whether it's a tooth it's loose. I'm not sure what it is there. So if they look at that and they determine, for example that I have to have some work on it, let's say they have, they decide to just give it up and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], do you do that at the time or is that going to be another appointment? If the time is allotted, yes. We. Can we talk to you before we move forward with any treatment, obviously. But yes, if the time is allotted, we can definitely try to do it that same [DURATION]. And. Yeah, so typically it's just up to the patient. If time is available, we would. We could definitely do it. Where. Where is that tooth located? It's lower. Right. It's. I don't know numbers, but it's just past my front teet. It's just past my three or four teeth in the front. It's like the second one past that or something. I think I have [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] implants, but I don't think it's. I don't think it's one of the implants. I think it's a tooth in front of the implants. Okay. Hopefully it's not an implant. I hope not. I don't believe it. Yeah, I don't believe it is. I believe it's another two. Okay. All right. So I will put a note in there that you have that area. That is a little bit of a concern, but we'll do a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] where'be sure. Get photos and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] of all of your teeth and [OCCUPATION] will go over treatment then. I do have three [OCCUPATION] that [DURATION]. I have [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. And so either one of them you would see if you have a preference. If you know one and you have a preference. And we can. I don't. I don't know any of them. So they're all very. Probably no preference at all. That's what I like to hear. Wonderful dinner. Yeah, they're wonderful. They are. So I think this. This insurance, if I remember the way they explained it, it allows for. I don't have any [OCCUPATION] pay or anything on this type of an issue. They just pay you so much to do this. I think it's twice a year or something. Is that what your recollection is or do you know that? I just. I don't know at the top of my head. I. We deal with thousands of insurances. I'm sure you do. I couldn't tell you. Once I look it up, I will know more and I'll have a better breakdown. But we'll know at the time of your service. We'll have that done before you'll come in. Okay. All right. So I have. You are sending me something to fill out, are you? Send me. It will be sent via either email or a text message to do your new. Okay, great. Forms. Yeah, Great. Yeah. Great. I'll get them all. Sure. Yeah, you should get them shortly. They come over pretty quickly, so. Oay. Goodkay. All right, excellent. Well, we look forward to meeting you and we will see you in [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DATE] [DATE], [TIME]. [TIME]. No, it's actually [DATE] [DATE]. Did I say [DATE_INTERVAL]? I'm in [DATE_INTERVAL]. That's what I have it on. Yeah. I was like, wait, hold on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. Okay. You're welcome. Thanks, [PERSON_NAME].

We're not in network with that insurance company, but we do see many patients with that. Okay, so if I went into my [MEDICAL_PROCESS], it wouldn't cover anything. There's typically a copay with it since we're not in network with them. So typically cop pay we see is between [MONEY_AMOUNT] and $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. All right, so that's all it would be, like [MONEY_AMOUNT], $[MONEY_AMOUNT] for [MEDICAL_PROCESS].

How may I help you? Hi there. I want to go ahead and get a reservation down. I might need to modify it, but I want to go ahead and get it on the book. And my dog's name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what is your last name? My last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I just want to make sure I have the right one. No, absolutely. If there's another [PERSON_NAME], I would not want that. Okay, and what kind of reservation would you like? So it's going to be overnight for quite a [DURATION] [DURATION]. Not [DURATION], but overnight. And when were you looking to book? So I would drop her [DATE] [DATE], which is a Sunday, and I would pick her up on [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. Team. Okay, that has no problem. And could you remind me what's the most basic? I want to make sure she gets a ton of play time while I'm gone. That's always my goal. So what's the cheapest one for the overnight? Those packages, that would be our classic suite. Okay, can you. So sorry, can you. I forget I've done these things before. But can you explain again what they get with the basics? Yes, ma'am. So if you get the classic suite, you can still get a different package. The one that. Yes, it's more extensive, but they would get [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play. And that's the gold. Because with the bronze W is the cheapest one. They only get one play session. Ah, okay. Oh, no, that's okay. Okay, so classic is she gets the room. The classic is the. So aside from the play times, what's the classic itself? Then again, I always get this confused all the time. Yeah, that's just the room. It's just basic room. Okay. Oh, yeah, the other ones, they have like a patio or something. Is that right? Yes, ma'am. Okay. No, she's fine with the basic. Like get her classic. But then what is the difference in price for [DURATION] [DURATION] play versus one play, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Let me go back. Give me one second. No problem. Take the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I see he's been here before, correct? Yeah, many times. Okay. And I have even some credits on file, but they're the [DURATION] ones. So you're not the overnight. Sorry about that. No, take your time. I'm actually creating an online. So the silver, which they have the [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play for the group is [MONEY_AMOUNT] on top of the room and that's [DURATION] [DURATION]. So like the classics, we have two $[MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and that's per [DURATION]. And then the gold is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. But they get the extra potty break. They still get the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. Oh, to the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does still give [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION] and the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION]. But the [MONEY_AMOUNT] has a few other things, is that right? Yes, ma'am. [MONEY_AMOUNT] and those things. Sorry. Okay, go ahead. A progress report which is like pictures and updates on how their stay is. And that's about it. Okay. Okay, so. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] sil. That would probably be two. Okay, so if I did keep this for her to have all they play, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then real quick, less than the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. What's the price for the T [DURATION]? Two play times or one playime? So the one play time would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is there a [DURATION] [DURATION] times or. No, that would be the silver. Would they get [DURATION] [DURATION] play time or they can do [DURATION] [DURATION] play? It just. It depends. Oh, interesting. Okay, that's interesting. So basically if I was to do that, I'm looking at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], is that correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Oh my gosh. Adds up. And then if I want to add in the nail clippings, I can tell you that. Correct. Let me see if you want to add in a nail clipping. Trying to see did you want the [OCCUPATION]. Done? The nail trim? The actually might do the other one where they save it down really good. That would probably be the dremel. It's like where they rounded out. Okay. Yeah. How much is that one? That's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then, and then the clipp thing is how much? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Can you add that on there? Because I know for sure she needs your nails done. Yeah, of course. Did you want both of them or just a nail trim? So for the nail trim. It. It'it'it. Just makes they sharper. Is that what it is? They don't. They don't round it out? Yes, ma'am. They just clip them. They don't round them? No, you could do both. Go ahead and do [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then my other question is how much is it? If the. How much fe is it? If she were to do some lessons? Do you have any less? I don't know if I want to do that. But do you have any lessons there that get added on? Any specials to get added on since it's still expensive? Let me see. So they would still be the same, like the same price O It wouldn't like give a discount or anything. It would just add on to the total at the end. Oh, okay. Okay. And then could you tell me what vaccine she's still in need of? Yes, ma'am. I had brought in paperwork to show she had one that was still good [DURATION] [DURATION] from the [OCCUPATION], but I don't know yet what would be the case. Yeah, of course. Did you want her to have like a.m. and p.m. play times or [DURATION] [DURATION]? Oh, definitely the [DURATION] [DURATION], yeah. Okay. And did you want that every [DURATION]? Every other [DURATION] I would put it. Let's put it down right now for every [DURATION]. Because my goal is that she so socialized this long time because she. She goes there, you know, she's obviously in the cloud, she with them. The problem though is that at home she's least reactive when I take her on walk. But at next [DURATION], you know, she does okay. Sometimes they bring her to the side, but you know, she's been able to be there [DURATION] [DURATION] when it comes to the playtime. And that's my goal is like to use this [DURATION] [DURATION] or of. For whatever long it is for her to be with dogs like the whole time. And I hope is it's gonna help her. Oh, I understand that. Give me one second. I'm trying to see about lodging. Okay. Sorry, I'm trying to reservation so I can check everything outse. Yeah, no problem. And you wanted to check on the vaccine? Yeah. What? God forbid. I got there, they're like, oh, she needs this and that. And then I'm like flying. I'm literally flying to [LOCATION]. Yeah, no, they're showing that they're all up to date. The only one that is about to expire is the [DRUG], which expires on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Awesome. I wouldn't you to get that before. Yes, ma'am. Okay, so border to. Are you guys doing any of the vaccine. You know, you guys do the vaccine thing in the parking lot? Yeah, they'll be here on the [DATE] from [TIME] to [TIME]. Okay, let me write that out on. Is it Sunday? Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'm gonna put that in here or to tell a Vacine. That way I have it and it's all done. Okay, that's. That's all. You know what time they're there on the [DATE]? [TIME] to [TIME] awesome. Okay. Is there anything else that I need to know right now? You don't charge the card or anything yet, right? In case I want to change this. Okay. I just want to'in there if you know if there's any special that [DURATION]. Like, I know I didn't do this, but it was [EVENT], I think. Like, you buy a pie, apple pie, something like. Is there any specials going on while she's there? I do not believe so, no, ma'am. But I think I'KNOW more around the time that she's coming in. Okay, that's good to know. Okay. All right. This is great. Thank you so much. I'm glad that I'm down. And then I. I'll circle back on anything I need to change. Yes, ma'am. And I have her down for the [DATE] through the [DATE]. Yeah. So my question actually is if I pick her up. I've done this before. Like, when I picked her up on the. Like, say that that Friday more. They didn't charge me for that Friday. If I did it by a certain time, they just charge me through Thursday. What's that time again? [TIME]. [TIME]. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. At least'save some money. Awesome. Okay, well, thank you so very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. You have a wonderful [DURATION]. You as well. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi. I wouldn just check in and to see what it would be to get my two dogs on like a [DRUG] [DRUG]. [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]. Have we seen the pets before? Youve seen one of them, but not the other. Okay. What's your last [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME] is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and the pets name_cy and we kind of like. I know that she may not sure that she's up to date on shop there, but we've been going other places and so we're just trying to get them on this since we're going to be out camping and things like that. Okay, let me look here. So in order to dispense any meds, we do have to do like a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So that [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that we do prior to starting is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that would be just the exam and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], assuming that [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is current, which you said that you had elsewhere. And then medication wise. So there's a couple different options. There'a monthly chewable that will run. Let's see. So she's a lab, so probably around like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a [DURATION]. Now you can buy it on a monthly basis or you can get like [DURATION] [DURATION] at a time, [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. There is also an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for [DRUG] [DRUG] that covers for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. That one's a little bit. It costs about the same as doing like [DURATION] [DURATION] of the chewables, and it would kind of depend on how much they weighed. Okay. We'd probably do the twow of able. Okay. So I think she's around [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. So you're saying that the exam would be like [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [PERSON_NAME] and then like, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on how many months. If we got like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] worth of those. Is that what we're. Yeah. Is the othero [PERSON_NAME]? No, [PERSON_NAME] passed away. So this one is [PERSON_NAME]. So she is a [NATIONALITY] shepherd. She just turned [PERSON_AGE]. All right. Because I have a [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME], so I'll get that changed in our system as well. So yeah, it would be basically the exam, [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], and then the chewables. As long as you bring in like [DRUG] [DRUG] history. Okay. And I'll have to double check. I don't. I mean, I don't think [PERSON_NAME] is up on her [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. So what would that cost if we needed to get that done? I think the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay. All Right. O. So about. And that'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT] for both dogs for the exam and then the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and then the [DRUG]. Right. It'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the exam and the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. And then the [DRUG] would be additional. So, yeah, if you got like, let me look here because they're both probably the size range goes from [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm guessing they're both in there. So those are [MONEY_AMOUNT] per tablets. So per [DURATION]. Okay. Okay, perfect. Al rightty. Well, let me talk that over with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I'll let you guys know. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I direct your call? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm a new person calling. I've never called you guys. I just looked you up in our insurance and I'm calling. Great. My son, we're actually building a house in [LOCATION]. We live in [LOCATION] right now. But my son is coming home from college and he called and asked me to make him an appointment for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But obviously he's not a patient. Ve so he's proably need an exam and whatnot. But he's only going to be here for the [DURATION] of the [DATE], and then he goes back to school for summer school. And I just want to know if you might have anything available while he's here the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. Well, he comes in on the [DATE], so he would have the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]. And he had two appointments. He needed a [OCCUPATION] and a [OCCUPATION] appointment for his ear. And I booked that at [TIME] on the [DATE]. But I can do anything else around that in the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. Sure, [PERSON_NAME], so we'd love to have you. We are booking out further than that, I think. But we can, if you like, put you on a waiting list and if something opens up, possibly get you sooner. Okay. What's your son's name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Is your name [PERSON_NAME]? I see it here on the caller idon y. I need to get you with our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Her name is [PERSON_NAME] and she'left for the [DURATION], but I can have her give you a call back, if that's okay. Sure. Our office opens again Monday, so [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], so we could get you in, get you verified, and get you on that next available list. And pop_ibly get an appointment that early, but it would just depend on a lot. Okay, well, what do you think the chances are? Not that good, because I might just like when he's home, you know, for the holidays or something, maybe start a new thing. But he really needs a [MEDICAL_PROCESS], so I only have that. Otherwise he's not going toa be home again till probably the fall, so. So let me get you over to [PERSON_NAME]. I think she's already left, but. Yeah, she's already left. Well, she can call me and if it works out fine. But I might, you know, I might still have to call around if he's on a waiting list, because I only have that Window of time that he's here. Want that date that he's here. Said it's the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. He's going to be here the [DATE], the [DATE] to [DATE] and [DATE] because you guys are not open on the weekends. Right? Right. Okay. And then he had another [OCCUPATION] appointment that he needed. So I have the one appointment booked on the [DATE] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. But I have anything before that, around that, after that and the rest of the [DURATION], [DATE] may open wide open for him to come anytime he can get in. Okay. I'm writing all this down to give to her. And then is he just needing in for the checkup and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or is there any like pain or any concerns and yeah, he doesn't have anything. He definitely hasn't been for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] since [MEDICAL_CONDITION] I'm sure being away at school he hasn't, but he has. Luckily we have a pretty. The genetics in our family are pretty good. I don't think are my kids have even had a [INJURY]. He had braces when he was in high school. Okay, so he just really wants the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is all he's asking for. I mean obviously I know he needs to exam but I mean that'what he. That's the purpose, not because he's having a problem. Okay. Just so [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and is F number the correct number to call you back on? Yeah. And then like I said, I found you guys in our insurance and we are [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. I know we have lots of patients with [ORGANIZATION]. If you have the subscriber ID and group number handy, I can take that down too. Maybe make. I can get it if you can hold on. I don't have it in front of me, but I can get it. Yeah, absolutely. I'll hold in my wallet. Actually, you know what? I think I don't have it exact because we don't get a card for that. It's under our blue closs per shield. So would it be the same number? I don't have a separate card for [OCCUPATION] for [DRUG]. You don't get a card for that. Okay. I think you look it up by I mean I can give you the employer. I mean when I do like the vision the same thing. We don't have a card for that. Usually when I have patients that have [DRUG], they log into their app to get the subscriber group number. I'm not sure that it's the same card as I don't use the app for it, but I do have. I mean, I do have an ID number for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] GroupW Shield and a group number and then the [OCCUPATION] coverages through that. You know, under that we don't have card I have for us. I'll take that down just in case it's a PPO. Okay, so the ID number, it's letters first. Okay, so [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Then [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay, so I have [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] no [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Perfect. Yep. And the group number is [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. What's after that? [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER].

Even when you're in, we can kind of at least discuss the different options with you. Okay, so what I'll do is when I bring [PERSON_NAME] and I'll talk to guys about an appointment. I've already. I just had my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, so it's not going to. I'm not eligible for any of that.

You're welcome. We'll see you then. Bye. || My answ for kits. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Yes, I'm calling in regards to schedule for my son. Okay, can I get the date of birth you said? Oh, sorry about that. Name [PERSON_NAME] for [PERSON_NAME]. Yes. Oay, look, I'm seeing in here that exams are done in [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Is that still correct? Yes. Okay, so let me go ahead and find you a I can do. Actually he's not due until [DATE] [DATE]. Oh, [DATE] [DATE]. Yes. So I can schedule him or you can call back when it gets closer around that time. Just so you know, your reared schedule a little bit better but it's totally up to you. Oh, okay. I mean because he had a spacer on one of his teeth and everything but his baby te'coming out and it came out but he is in no pain, no anything. And so that'where the only reason why I was calling in regards. But yeah, if he's not doing until [DATE] then yeah, okay. As long as he's not in any pain, I think he'll be okay. And you, if it does start causing pain then you can go ahead and give us a call and we can get you in as soon as we can. But as far as the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and exam go, that's up to you about when you want to schedule. Okay. I mean if he's not due until [DATE_INTERVAL], then yeah, that's fine. I just, I had it totally mixed up. I. I'm pretty sure he's getting close. I need to schedule. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I could just either call like when it gets kind of closer to that time. Yeah, that sounds good. And then another small question. I don't know if you could do it over the phone, but I'm also having a little mix up with my son's Medicaid. I was wondering what, what case number is it under? Because I've been basically going back and forth with the office and it's trying to state that he has two cases in [LOCATION]. Let's see. So are you wanting the subscriber id like the group number? Basically the Medicaid number, yeah. Okay, so I have that. I'm going to double check and make sure it's still up to date. Okay. [PERSON_NAME], he. Get your water bottle and backpack ready. Okay, so that number is going to be the letter [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER], the number [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okie [OCCUPATION]. Okay, cool. Thank you. Yeah, because I've been having troubles with scheduling him with a [OCCUPATION] appointnt for his [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then it'saying that his [OCCUPATION] having trouble Medicaid and stating that he has two cases. And I'm like, no. And I have this problem where I think they're thinking that it'for me, but really it's my st. I don't know how they can't decipher it. So I don't know. It's because we have the same. Same name, basically. Yeah. I don't know exactly. But I do know that Medicaid is for dental in health. It's different. So I'm not sure if there is a different group number or subscriber ID to that, but I do know that they are different. So he could be eligible for dental health, but he cannot be eligible for medical health. And I think. I think they are supposed to give two separate cards as well. Oh, okay. Yeah. Because I've been trying to get hold with them and they're basically like too busy, I guess, for this time of the year. Yeah, I thought. Yeah. Well, okay. Thank you. You've been a big help. Of course. All right. You have a wonderful rest of your day. Thanks. And me too. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], how may I help you? [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME], my name is [PERSON_NAME]. Good morning and I'm a patient of [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. I have was wondering want I'm getting new health insurance for my work, where I work and stuff and they have a couple choices for which dental plan I can get. Like they have like [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. Do you know what what dental plants he works with or he's a member in the network. The only one he is in network with is [ORGANIZATION]. Now he will accept and build the rest of them. I just don't know exactly which one is the best choice. But I can connect you with the person who does the insurance and they can go over that with you. Oh, that'be nice. Okay. All right, give me just a second. Thanks. They use a company called [ORGANIZATION] or something like that. One minute. Right. Hy [PERSON_NAME], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hey, how are you? Good morning. Good. Okay, so tell me what your options are. Okay, yeah, I got like a couple of options. Let me, let me go back to the screen, but. Well, one'dental from my memory is [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and then there's a [ORGANIZATION] and then there's a [ORGANIZATION]. Let me take a look and see 'open it up againrry and on the [LOCATION], if you can look and tell me which state, that'be helpful. Okay, definitely. Let me go ahead, try to get back in there to log back in for a second. Okay, log in. Okay'srol. Continue. Okay, continue. Okay, so I have this choice is [ORGANIZATION], dental, oval. They say o I have a couple. Well, so [ORGANIZATION] would they have like dental, 50 Vol dental value, valved, all this other stuff, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. And what do you want me to, to look up? Sorry. Okay, so there's like a [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] of which state, which state is? Oh, this is [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. Okay, if you said [LOCATION], I was going to be like absolutely, do not do [LOCATION]. Okay, let's see. Yeah, I say they same with it. [PERSON_NAME]. Let me write these down. So. Oh yeah. Okayah. I don't have second. Well, these are the choices that they're giving me, but. Okay, sorry. Okay, I'm ready. Okay. Ye one'aetna [ORGANIZATION] E T N [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and then, then the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and then the [ORGANIZATION] and the [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, so you can scratch [ORGANIZATION] because not good. Okay. If I were you, I would go with and I would have to like see the particulars of the plans to see if they have a [INJURY] [INJURY] quause a waiting period. Okay, like things. Is there any way that you can send me a picture of like what your options are? Oh yeah, I could and I can plan summary with favor eligibility, benefits and coverage services. And you see, I could try my best to do it. They have like orth min maximums and [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. BPO [OCCUPATION]. Okay. Yeah. I mean to. Actually I would need to know like the specifics to tell you which one is the best becausek some of them. So some of them have a [INJURY] [INJURY] clies. Which means if you were missing. So if you had say [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] ago and then you got this plan and you wanted to get a bridge or an implant or whatever to replace that tooth, they're not going to replace that tooth because they have a [INJURY] [INJURY] clauses. Wow. So that's why I'm asking for kind of specifics. And then some of them will have a waiting period so they'll pay for like [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and maybe [MEDICAL_PROCESS] but then you have to wait up. You have to wait and pay for the insurance for [DURATION] [DURATION] before they'll pay for anything else. So. Okay. That's why I'm kind of needing the specifics of the plans and I don't know if it will be easier for you to email me or you can just screenshot it and send me a text which. What would be better for you? Either one, I guess I'm not sure how to do it. That's what I'm trying to figure out. But um. But yeah, I can email to you what I get from descriptions and. Okay, what's your email? So I could try that [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Okay. Okay, got it. Okay. Okay. And one word. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] is one word. Yep. And that way I can kind of look at all of it and then. And give you your best option from there. That's awesome. You'so awesome. Thank you for being so nice about it. Appreciate. Oh yeah, you're welcome. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll. I'll send it as soon as I can. Okay. All right, thank you. Bye. || This isl. How may I help you? I'm sorry. Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Oh, I said. What was your name? I'm sorry. [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, hi, [PERSON_NAME]. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. I'm interested in boarding with you guys. I just wanted to see if you can quote me a price. And I also wanted to know, do you guys require the. I'm not sure of the [MEDICAL_PROCESS], but I know it's a boarding [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. I'm trying to see if you guys acired the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. Yes. Is that okay? So yes, we do require it, but we do also have a [DURATION] [DURATION] waiver if you can't get it in time. Yes. So after the [DURATION] [DURATION] waiver up though it is absolutely required by then. Okay. So I wanted to bring my pit bull, he's a Bluno pit bull for the dates of [DATE] [DATE]. I don't know if you guys are doing that far, but it [DATE] [DATE] through the [DATE]. I believe that's that Wednesday, whatever that Wednesday is after the [DATE]. Yes, I see that here. So here's what I can do. So you're just wanting a quote or do you want to go ahead and create an account with us? I just want to quote. I'm just looking around right now. This is his second time going, so I'm just looking around right now. Okay, for sure. All right, let me look for you. So that is. That would be [DURATION] [DURATION], correct? Yes. [DURATION] [DURATION]. Would you want him with any play times at all? Yeah, so the playt times are extra. Let me just for the [DURATION], for the [DURATION] [DURATION] it is [MONEY_AMOUNT] for just the room. Okay. And if I was to add play time. So if you were to add play time, just depending on the package you get dep the prices vary. And is your dog good with other animals? I guess you could in like [DURATION] [DURATION] tier setting. Yes. From the first time he went, I had no problem. They didn't complain or anything. So from what I know, yes. And I do have two dogs, so he's pretty good with my other dog. Okay, so are you wanting to board your other dog too? No, no, no. Okay. So my biggest suggestion for you is the FLTIME packages are way cheaper if they are eligible for group. So how they get eligible is you schedule them for [DURATION] [DURATION] to come in and the evaluation first [DURATION] is always free. And the evaluation is. And we will evaluate your dog to see how he is with the other animals. And if he passes evaluation, he gets to go into group with everybody else. Okay. So I can Set that up now? Yes, yes. If you want to go ahead and get them evaluated. I mean, I do highly suggest it just because the price difference is huge. I mean, I can for sure tell you that. Would you like me to go ahead and create an account for you? Yeah, we go ahead and create an account. Okay, so if he does get into a group, how much would that price be? Because I'm pretty sure he will. My dog is pretty much for me. Okay. So would you want one play time [DURATION] [DURATION] or two? So we have [MONEY_AMOUNT] separate packages. So it just depends on what you would want for him. That's one play time every [DURATION]? Yes. So like for example, our bronze for social, if he were to be in group is $[MONEY_AMOUNT], which is just one playime [DURATION] [DURATION] and a specialty treat for him. And our silver is [MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] and that he would be able to play 12 today. So he would have [DURATION] [DURATION] play in group and have the specialty treat. And then our last one is gold, it's the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] package. And that one he plays [DURATION] [DURATION]. He would have an extra pot break and you would get an update on him. Progress report every [DURATION] of his stay and a specialty treat. I know it's a lot of information. Okay, so if he doesn't get playime, he just in the cage for [DURATION] [DURATION], I mean, [DURATION] [DURATION]. So he would get to go out to go potty. But yes, for the most part, he would be in his room. You know, we do as staff, we do go back there. Like I work up at the front desk, but I will go back there and hang out and sit in the kennel with some dogs who don't have play times every once in a while. But sometimes there's not opportunities to just sit and hang out with them. I always do suggest play times, but they aren't required. Unless you book where to book him in a luxury suite. We do. Also we have our luxury suites, which are [MONEY_AMOUNT] a night. Our classic suites are the ones I was telling you about getting you a quote for which is the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] night. Okay. So if I was to get the bronze package, I guess the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION] for playtime. All right. And you'd want that every [DURATION] of this stay, correct? O well. And you don't have to schedule. I know. It's so much information. You don't have to schedule it every [DURATION] of his state either. So if you wanted like every other [DURATION] or anything like that, you can pick and choose what [DURATION] you want it of it. Stay. I didn'like When I. When I gave him the first time, it wasn't like this. But you guys are really, really different. So I just gave them like the date. It included like the play time, everything. It just gave me a certain price. But I think you guys are like in a building, they like in a house. So I think we are a whole facility. I mean, typically [DURATION] to [DURATION], we have a little over [MONEY_AMOUNT] dogs. So it just depends. And I mean, like I said, if you think your dog would do great in group, I mean, with the bronze on his package for that amount of time. So he'd be here [DURATION] [DURATION], [DURATION] [DURATION]. And so I put the number of [DURATION] for [DURATION], which was that price I had given you earlier. But with the bronze social playt times added to that, it is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. One second, [PERSON_NAME]. Hold on one second, [PERSON_NAME]. Let me take this call. Hold on one second. Really, really quick. Oay. I'm back. Thank you so much. All right. Of course. So with the bronze on every [DURATION] of his stay, if he were to pass evaluation, it would be [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the [DURATION] [DURATION]. And that. That's everyday play time. That's every [DURATION]? Yes, ma'am. And it would be with the bronze, it's a one would be like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] playtime. So he'd get [DURATION] [DURATION] of playtime [DURATION] [DURATION]. That's not bad because you don't get any play time at home. You just get walked. But of. Okay. Allgh. Well, thank you so much. I am going to pick back to you guys. Okay? Okay, for sure. Just let us know. Thank you. All right, no problem. Bye. Byee. || Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME] from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I help you? Hi, my name is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], and my dogs [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME] has come and stayed a few times with y'all. And I need to see if you guys have any availability for them to stay the night on this coming [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. What is it, the [DATE], [DATE], whatever that is. [TIME]. Okay, let's see. The [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], I believe. There you go. Saturday, yes. So I would drop off Friday afternoon and then I would pick up Saturday morning. Saturday morning. Got it. I will get that book for you. Give me just a second to load it and I can make your reservation for you. Perfect. And then I have one more question for you. So [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME] always share a kennel together because they sleep on the same bed here. About [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, we actually got a third dog. His name is [PERSON_NAME] and he is a corgi. And yes, yes. It's like it's the antithesis of each other. Right? Like the big ma. It's so funny becausek you so huge. And [PERSON_NAME]. Oh, my God. And this is exactly. Well, [PERSON_NAME] we went through here. He got all of his [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. He has all of his raaby records. The only issue that we have is he is not going to get [MEDICAL_PROCESS] until the following Tuesday. Would it be a problem to bring him as well? No. So they could still share the same room because the two are already fixed and they're both poys, so they're going to be fine. They can share the same room. Awesome. Even if they're not fixed. The only thing is we won't be able to let them play with other dogs. If you want to do playtime for [PERSON_NAME], it'll have to be individuals. Wait, how old is [PERSON_NAME], by the way? [PERSON_NAME] is [PERSON_AGE] [PERSON_AGE] old. Okay. Yeah. So unfortunately, he'll have to do individuals because if he was [PERSON_AGE] to [PERSON_AGE] [PERSON_AGE], then he would be eligible for his PUPP public preschool. But unfortunately, could he do an individual playtime with just the other two dogs? Yeah. Yeah. So we can actually pull them both for the play times. And if you want to do where they alternate, where they go in a group and then they do individuals with doors. And we can do that too. Just let them know it. O. That sounds perfect. But all [PERSON_AGE] of them can share the same room and that's all good to go. Yes. So let me just add to your profile. I can get them all booked for you. [LOCATION] [NATIONALITY] corgi. He is he. But he has the merle blue on his back. Oh, that's so. That's gorgeous. I have a triolor. So do you. O y. I love the tries too. They're so cute. Yes, he is full fluffy too. So he doesn't shed as much. Nice. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME] sheds that. He's not nearly as bad as [PERSON_NAME]. Like [PERSON_NAME] is that husky hair just goes everywhere. Cool hair all the time. It's so funny. I was petting him last time he came and my hair came off and I was like oh no. Yeah. It's just all the time and we do the d sheds and stuff. It doesn't matter. He'always hair coming off. By the way, do you know [PERSON_NAME] birthday? [PERSON_NAME] birthday? We have down as [PERSON_AGE]. [PERSON_AGE]. Okay, let me put that down. Do you know an approximate weight for [PERSON_NAME]? He is [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. My gosh. A babyay clinic does you go to? I'm sorry, what? That clinic does he go to? I still missed it. One more time. I'm so sorry. Sorry. What the clinic does he go to? He. Oh, he goes to the same. Yes, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, I have added him to your profile. He has blue merle on his back and then he is a old. He's not fix but we will update that and that's going to be rectified in like [DURATION] [DURATION]. So then the next time he comes to visit he'll be [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Yes. I'm so excited can wait to meet you. I'll get them all booked in the same room. Did you want to do the book the play times now or just whenever check in. You can just decide then when we check in. Well, I'll ask you guys what your availability looks like and we'll just of go from there. All right. So I have it booked for you. You drop off this Friday, pick up Saturday. They're all in the same room. I have them in a large room so they're a little more spacious. Yes, thank you. You're all set. And you jobs off anytime as early as [TIME] you have until [TIME] and then you can have until [TIME] to pick up. So you're perectly awesome. So great. Thank you so much. No problem. We'll see you this Friday. Sounds great. Bye. By."

This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I direct your call? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm a new person calling. I've never called you guys. I just looked you up in our insurance and I'm calling. Great. My son, we're actually building a house in [LOCATION]. We live in [LOCATION] right now. But my son is coming home from college and he called and asked me to make him an appointment for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But obviously he's not a patient. Ve so he's proably need an exam and whatnot. But he's only going to be here for the [DURATION] of the [DATE], and then he goes back to school for summer school. And I just want to know if you might have anything available while he's here the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. Well, he comes in on the [DATE], so he would have the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]. And he had two appointments. He needed a [OCCUPATION] and a [OCCUPATION] appointment for his ear. And I booked that at [TIME] on the [DATE]. But I can do anything else around that in the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. Sure, [PERSON_NAME], so we'd love to have you. We are booking out further than that, I think. But we can, if you like, put you on a waiting list and if something opens up, possibly get you sooner. Okay. What's your son's name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Is your name [PERSON_NAME]? I see it here on the caller idon y. I need to get you with our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Her name is [PERSON_NAME] and she'left for the [DURATION], but I can have her give you a call back, if that's okay. Sure. Our office opens again Monday, so [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], so we could get you in, get you verified, and get you on that next available list. And pop_ibly get an appointment that early, but it would just depend on a lot. Okay, well, what do you think the chances are? Not that good, because I might just like when he's home, you know, for the holidays or something, maybe start a new thing. But he really needs a [MEDICAL_PROCESS], so I only have that. Otherwise he's not going toa be home again till probably the fall, so. So let me get you over to [PERSON_NAME]. I think she's already left, but. Yeah, she's already left. Well, she can call me and if it works out fine. But I might, you know, I might still have to call around if he's on a waiting list, because I only have that Window of time that he's here. Want that date that he's here. Said it's the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. He's going to be here the [DATE], the [DATE] to [DATE] and [DATE] because you guys are not open on the weekends. Right? Right. Okay. And then he had another [OCCUPATION] appointment that he needed. So I have the one appointment booked on the [DATE] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. But I have anything before that, around that, after that and the rest of the [DURATION], [DATE] may open wide open for him to come anytime he can get in. Okay. I'm writing all this down to give to her. And then is he just needing in for the checkup and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or is there any like pain or any concerns and yeah, he doesn't have anything. He definitely hasn't been for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] since [MEDICAL_CONDITION] I'm sure being away at school he hasn't, but he has. Luckily we have a pretty. The genetics in our family are pretty good. I don't think are my kids have even had a [INJURY]. He had braces when he was in high school. Okay, so he just really wants the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is all he's asking for. I mean obviously I know he needs to exam but I mean that'what he. That's the purpose, not because he's having a problem. Okay. Just so [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and is F number the correct number to call you back on? Yeah. And then like I said, I found you guys in our insurance and we are [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. I know we have lots of patients with [ORGANIZATION]. If you have the subscriber ID and group number handy, I can take that down too. Maybe make. I can get it if you can hold on. I don't have it in front of me, but I can get it. Yeah, absolutely. I'll hold in my wallet. Actually, you know what? I think I don't have it exact because we don't get a card for that. It's under our blue closs per shield. So would it be the same number? I don't have a separate card for [OCCUPATION] for [DRUG]. You don't get a card for that. Okay. I think you look it up by I mean I can give you the employer. I mean when I do like the vision the same thing. We don't have a card for that. Usually when I have patients that have [DRUG], they log into their app to get the subscriber group number. I'm not sure that it's the same card as I don't use the app for it, but I do have. I mean, I do have an ID number for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] GroupW Shield and a group number and then the [OCCUPATION] coverages through that. You know, under that we don't have card I have for us. I'll take that down just in case it's a PPO. Okay, so the ID number, it's letters first. Okay, so [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Then [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay, so I have [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] no [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER].

I had a tooth that was [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago. It could not be saved and been curious about getting an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or a bridge. Yeah, most definitely. Y. Yeah, we can go ahead. We can even get you for a complimentary consult kind to do an evaluation, see what would be best treatment and then we can go over those benefits with you regarding the insurance, if that's something you're interested in, we can get that all taken care of. Even when you're in, we can kind of at least discuss the different options with you. Okay, so what I'll do is when I bring [PERSON_NAME] and I'll talk to guys about an appointment. I've already. I just had my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago, so it's not going to. I'm not eligible for any of that. So it would have, you know, do something totally separate. Okay, perfect. Definitely. All right, well, we look forward to meeting you guys and seeing you. I will send an email with those that paperwork if you can please fill that out. And then when you guys do come in, just please bring your ID and insurance cards. Okay? Thank you so much. You're welcome. We'll see you then. Bye. || It's a great [DURATION] here at [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Yes, it is a great [DURATION]. It's not so hot outside. Yes ma'am. I need to set an appointment for. I guess I need to get both [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME] paid. Okay, let me see here. Are we want to do to the same time or you want to spread them out? I guess at the same time that way they'll both be soari and won't hurt each other. Yes, ma'am. Let's see here. Now when I came home from getting her groomed on [DATE] [DATE] about the next [DURATION] [PERSON_NAME] went into heat But I think she's out of it now. I didn't look today. Yesterday she was still a little bit swollen so it should be just a matter of days and she'll be completely clear. Okay, no problem. It looks like my first available would be. Let me get you a good [DURATION]. What about Monday? This coming Monday? Yes, ma'am. Oh, okay. I wasn't expecting it that. What time do I need to bring them in? So you would need to drop them off between [TIME] and [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Oh, that's see vis you less I don't get up till [TIME]. No, I'll do it, I'll do it. I suffer from myup [DRUG] [DRUG]. Just give them some [DRUG] [DRUG] so they're not hurting so much at the end of the [DURATION] is why we have you get them here so early. I want to tell you something really stupid. You're gonna slap me the next time you see me. I'm [PERSON_AGE] years old. I have had dogs since I could walk. I have had all of them [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and all that good stuff. I am so worried about [PERSON_NAME] for some reason I think I love her more I've ever loved another puppy. I'm really worried about it. I've been putting this off dreading ites I completely saying I'm the same way with one of mine. So I think that must be it that you favor one more than the other. Love dog, she thrilled my heart. Okay, [TIME], [TIME] [TIME] Monday. [TIME], [TIME] [TIME]. I mean [TIME] [TIME]. [TIME] [TIME] to [TIME] y if you get here at [TIME] oock, I'm notn toa be here then you're gonna be mad at me. Yeah, I'mnna be mad at you so don't tell me your name. Yes ma'also I have a great pyrenees that I this had three baths in his life. He's [TIME] years old, had three bass in his life. Since I moved down here, he's had three more, and that's been since [DATE_INTERVAL] because he gets so filthy. But I need to bring him in. He has a [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [TIME] [TIME] [OCCUPATION], and I didn't want to spend the money to get the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] because of his age. But the [OCCUPATION] in high hospital just gives me [DRUG] and it calls for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. I just give him [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and he does great. But I need to get him checked out by your [OCCUPATION] so I can keep getting this [DRUG] because I can go [DURATION] [DURATION] without it, he starts hurting. Okay, how about this? How about do you want to do for [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]? Did you want to do come in at [TIME], [TIME] that morning on Monday? Okay. Would that be better? No. Yeah, that's fine. It doesn't matter. I'll set my alarm and get them there. Okay. Boy, y'all take care of my little black curly dog. Because listen, she can sit down, she can stand up on her hind legs and walk for me. She can sneaky peek, which means get down on her belly and crawl across the floor. She can roll over and she is so cute when she's really hungry, she gets [TIME] [TIME] floor and just does all. Oh, no. Yes, ma'am. Goodness, she's a smart little girl. She souk. Okay, [TIME]. Say [TIME] Monday. And. Yes, ma'am, do you think I ought to wait until then and make an appointment with [PERSON_NAME]? Because I had to bring him in. He looks so dirty all the time. He's stayained with mud. And I, you know, I bathe him and clean him up and condition him, and then the next [DURATION] looks the same. I'll just bring him in dirty and let y'all look at him. Okay, no problem. Did you want to set it up for when you come in on Monday? We can get it all set up for you. Yeah, I'PROBABLY need to bring them in and come back and get him, though, because he takes up the whole backseat. He's huge. Yes, ma'am. What we can do is if it makes it better, it might be a lot because you'll be making two trips up here. If you wanted to, I guess you can bring them in. Do you want to bring them all in together? You just want to do it all separately? I'd rather bring [PERSON_NAME] in byself. So I'just It's a ch him [TIME] [TIME] car, right? So how about since you'll have your hands full with your two babies, [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME], and how about we hold when you get here on Monday, we'll make [PERSON_NAME] appointment so it's not so much. Okay, that sounds good. Remind me, because I'll be all [TIME] [TIME] flutter over my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Absolutely. Yes, ma'am. Oay. What is today? What [DURATION] is it? Today is Wednesday. Wednesday. Okay. Okay. All right, so I got your babies down, and then when you get here on Monday, we'll set up for [PERSON_NAME]. Okay? Sounds good. Okay. See you then. Yes, ma'am. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi there. I'm looking to book [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME] to stay in [DATE_INTERVAL]. Okay. What [DURATION]? Drop off [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE] and pick up. Sorry. Drop off [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE], pick up [DATE_INTERVAL] [DATE]. And they usually board in separate rooms. Right. I think last time they moved them to the same room because they kept rubbing their noses or something. So I'm not sure. I'm not sure exactly what you guys are doing right now, to be honest. Let me check. I'm going to ask you back. Ok? Okay. Hello. Hi. Okay, so they said that their last day they did best together in the same room. Either a king or a luxury room. Oh, okay. Okay. We can do that. Is there a king room available for those dates? We should. Let me just double check. What's the last name? [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, we have plenty of king rooms available. So you want to do the king? Yeah, sure. That'd be great. All right. All right. So we just need to collect the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] deposit. Do you want to use the card on file? Oh, hold on. Let me grab my card. All right. It's okay. We have the one ending in [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]. Oh, no. I'll give you a new card number. Oay all. Are you ready? Ye expiration date and then the [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER] digits on the back. And what's the zip code? [LOCATION]. Oay. All right, you're all booked and you should be getting a confirmation text and email. Okay. Okay, great. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Byee. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Hey, [PERSON_NAME] is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? Good, how are you doing? Good. I've been working with the insurance company on this treatment plan that was proposed [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] ago when I came in for my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and actually had them yesterday. And you guys on the phone together trying to identify some of these codes, I guess for the treatment and the only one that they were able to. Well, first off, before I continue, am I talking to the right person? I am the one who did your treatment plan. Oh, okay, perfect. You are the right person. Nice. Okay, good. So we talked a little bit about the costs and how the quads are broken down under that code, but they could not find a code. The two codes that [PERSON_NAME] gave us yesterday for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and the ste ###l life they could not find. And they said they would need some type of narrative of the service. And then also she asked me, the insurance company asked, if you had that investment broken down into each of those sections because you have that as a total treatment. But I am assuming that these three items in here are actually price separately when it comes down to it. Yeses. Do we know what those. Go ahead. I was just wondering if we could identify what each of those sections cost and then I can get back to her and explain that. And then I wanted to ask you guys one other thing too. So [PERSON_NAME] was telling me that, you know, once you do the initial treatment, then you do this maintenance and you come in more often for the maintenance. The insurance company said that they pay for two, they pay up to 80% of the maintenance. Hang on, let me get my glasses on here. Make sure I'm seeing it. So they pay up to 80% of the maintenance [MEDICAL_PROCESS] twice a year, but then they also pay for two regular [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So I wanted to know, since I'm pretty early, if this is something at this stage, since we're catching it earlier, is if I do the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then I come back [DURATION] [DURATION] later and do a regular [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then I do a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then like every other time to help with the insurance portion, or if that's not recommended at all, because if it's for maintenance [MEDICAL_PROCESS], then I would have 20% out of pocket for two, and then two of them fully out of pocket, and I would need to know, I guess, what I'm looking at for each, what is the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] cost too, so I can evaluate kind of a direction I need to go as well. If that Makes any sense? That makes sense, yeah. So I can go ahead and actually send over that breakdown of the treatment to your email. So that way you can see like it priced out and those service codes, the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] rent so that one insurance won't recognize only because that is something that is like sold through our office. It's like a magicinal. [PERSON_NAME], I got you. Let me check this really quick. It looks like they, it looks like they, they cover 80% per each quad up to a max. So it looks favorable that I'm going to get quite a bit of help from the insurance company. But I wasn't sure I wanted to get back to her about the individual pricing. Then I wasn't sure how much the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] was and if you know, the [OCCUPATION] felt at this stage if, if I went, if I alternated the maintenance and regular [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and come in more often every [DURATION] [DURATION] instead of every [DURATION] [DURATION], if we're early enough that that would work until something would require us to change for maintenance. So those are some questions I have before I kind of move forward with this whole thing. Absolutely. So I can check on that. I will say once you are doing the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] usually that means that, that you can't necessarily go back to regular [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So that's something I will check with the [OCCUPATION] on. But I can tell you that that [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for your [DURATION] [DURATION] follow up would be about [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] without insurance. [MONEY_AMOUNT] without insurance. So if they don't, if that's not an option at the stage I'm at that I'm looking at two of them at [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then two of them at 20% of that. So basically [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] times 2 plus [MONEY_AMOUNT] so annually around [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. But I would still like to know what they thought of that. Just out of curiosity, see if that's an option. Yeah, I can definitely double check and then I can give you a call back just to kind of follow up and then let me double check that we have your email really quick. Okay. I do not. What would be a good email for you? Itig my last name [PERSON_NAME] all spelled out. All right. So yes. Okay, perfect. So I will go ahead and email that over to you here shortly. If you don't get it today, it'be on my list for tomorrow and then I will go ahead and get with a hygiene. Okay. All right, that sounds great. I appreciate your help. Yes, you're welcome. If anything else comes up, go ahead and give us a call, okay? Okay. Thanks. You re welcome. Bye. Have a good day. Bye."

Our luxury suite are [MONEY_AMOUNT] and our Plic Sueets are [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then on top of that you would pay for play time. Okay, and how much is play time? So we have three play time options. We have our $[MONEY_AMOUNT] option which is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], so [DURATION] [DURATION] of play. And then we have a silver play time which is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION].

Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Call back if you have any other questions. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I help you? Hi there. I want to go ahead and get a reservation down. I might need to modify it, but I want to go ahead and get it on the book. And my dog's name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what is your last name? My last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I just want to make sure I have the right one. No, absolutely. If there's another [PERSON_NAME], I would not want that. Okay, and what kind of reservation would you like? So it's going to be overnight for quite a [DURATION] [DURATION]. Not [DURATION], but overnight. And when were you looking to book? So I would drop her [DATE] [DATE], which is a Sunday, and I would pick her up on [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. Team. Okay, that has no problem. And could you remind me what's the most basic? I want to make sure she gets a ton of play time while I'm gone. That's always my goal. So what's the cheapest one for the overnight? Those packages, that would be our classic suite. Okay, can you. So sorry, can you. I forget I've done these things before. But can you explain again what they get with the basics? Yes, ma'am. So if you get the classic suite, you can still get a different package. The one that. Yes, it's more extensive, but they would get [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play. And that's the gold. Because with the bronze W is the cheapest one. They only get one play session. Ah, okay. Oh, no, that's okay. Okay, so classic is she gets the room. The classic is the. So aside from the play times, what's the classic itself? Then again, I always get this confused all the time. Yeah, that's just the room. It's just basic room. Okay. Oh, yeah, the other ones, they have like a patio or something. Is that right? Yes, ma'am. Okay. No, she's fine with the basic. Like get her classic. But then what is the difference in price for [DURATION] [DURATION] play versus one play, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Let me go back. Give me one second. No problem. Take the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I see he's been here before, correct? Yeah, many times. Okay. And I have even some credits on file, but they're the [DURATION] ones. So you're not the overnight. Sorry about that. No, take your time. I'm actually creating an online. So the silver, which they have the [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play for the group is [MONEY_AMOUNT] on top of the room and that's [DURATION] [DURATION]. So like the classics, we have two $[MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and that's per [DURATION]. And then the gold is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. But they get the extra potty break. They still get the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. Oh, to the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does still give [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION] and the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION]. But the [MONEY_AMOUNT] has a few other things, is that right? Yes, ma'am. [MONEY_AMOUNT] and those things. Sorry. Okay, go ahead. A progress report which is like pictures and updates on how their stay is. And that's about it. Okay. Okay, so. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] sil. That would probably be two. Okay, so if I did keep this for her to have all they play, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then real quick, less than the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. What's the price for the T [DURATION]? Two play times or one playime? So the one play time would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is there a [DURATION] [DURATION] times or. No, that would be the silver. Would they get [DURATION] [DURATION] play time or they can do [DURATION] [DURATION] play? It just. It depends. Oh, interesting. Okay, that's interesting. So basically if I was to do that, I'm looking at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], is that correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Oh my gosh. Adds up. And then if I want to add in the nail clippings, I can tell you that. Correct. Let me see if you want to add in a nail clipping. Trying to see did you want the [OCCUPATION]. Done? The nail trim? The actually might do the other one where they save it down really good. That would probably be the dremel. It's like where they rounded out. Okay. Yeah. How much is that one? That's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then, and then the clipp thing is how much? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Can you add that on there? Because I know for sure she needs your nails done. Yeah, of course. Did you want both of them or just a nail trim? So for the nail trim. It. It'it'it. Just makes they sharper. Is that what it is? They don't. They don't round it out? Yes, ma'am. They just clip them. They don't round them? No, you could do both. Go ahead and do [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then my other question is how much is it? If the. How much fe is it? If she were to do some lessons? Do you have any less? I don't know if I want to do that. But do you have any lessons there that get added on? Any specials to get added on since it's still expensive? Let me see. So they would still be the same, like the same price O It wouldn't like give a discount or anything. It would just add on to the total at the end. Oh, okay. Okay. And then could you tell me what vaccine she's still in need of? Yes, ma'am. I had brought in paperwork to show she had one that was still good [DURATION] [DURATION] from the [OCCUPATION], but I don't know yet what would be the case. Yeah, of course. Did you want her to have like a.m. and p.m. play times or [DURATION] [DURATION]? Oh, definitely the [DURATION] [DURATION], yeah. Okay. And did you want that every [DURATION]? Every other [DURATION] I would put it. Let's put it down right now for every [DURATION]. Because my goal is that she so socialized this long time because she. She goes there, you know, she's obviously in the cloud, she with them. The problem though is that at home she's least reactive when I take her on walk. But at next [DURATION], you know, she does okay. Sometimes they bring her to the side, but you know, she's been able to be there [DURATION] [DURATION] when it comes to the playtime. And that's my goal is like to use this [DURATION] [DURATION] or of. For whatever long it is for her to be with dogs like the whole time. And I hope is it's gonna help her. Oh, I understand that. Give me one second. I'm trying to see about lodging. Okay. Sorry, I'm trying to reservation so I can check everything outse. Yeah, no problem. And you wanted to check on the vaccine? Yeah. What? God forbid. I got there, they're like, oh, she needs this and that. And then I'm like flying. I'm literally flying to [LOCATION]. Yeah, no, they're showing that they're all up to date. The only one that is about to expire is the [DRUG], which expires on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Awesome. I wouldn't you to get that before. Yes, ma'am. Okay, so border to. Are you guys doing any of the vaccine. You know, you guys do the vaccine thing in the parking lot? Yeah, they'll be here on the [DATE] from [TIME] to [TIME]. Okay, let me write that out on. Is it Sunday? Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'm gonna put that in here or to tell a Vacine. That way I have it and it's all done. Okay, that's. That's all. You know what time they're there on the [DATE]? [TIME] to [TIME] awesome. Okay. Is there anything else that I need to know right now? You don't charge the card or anything yet, right? In case I want to change this. Okay. I just want to'in there if you know if there's any special that [DURATION]. Like, I know I didn't do this, but it was [EVENT], I think. Like, you buy a pie, apple pie, something like. Is there any specials going on while she's there? I do not believe so, no, ma'am. But I think I'KNOW more around the time that she's coming in. Okay, that's good to know. Okay. All right. This is great. Thank you so much. I'm glad that I'm down. And then I. I'll circle back on anything I need to change. Yes, ma'am. And I have her down for the [DATE] through the [DATE]. Yeah. So my question actually is if I pick her up. I've done this before. Like, when I picked her up on the. Like, say that that Friday more. They didn't charge me for that Friday. If I did it by a certain time, they just charge me through Thursday. What's that time again? [TIME]. [TIME]. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. At least'save some money. Awesome. Okay, well, thank you so very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. You have a wonderful [DURATION]. You as well. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi. I wouldn just check in and to see what it would be to get my two dogs on like a [DRUG] [DRUG]. [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]. Have we seen the pets before? Youve seen one of them, but not the other. Okay. What's your last [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME] is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and the pets name_cy and we kind of like. I know that she may not sure that she's up to date on shop there, but we've been going other places and so we're just trying to get them on this since we're going to be out camping and things like that. Okay, let me look here. So in order to dispense any meds, we do have to do like a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So that [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that we do prior to starting is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that would be just the exam and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], assuming that [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is current, which you said that you had elsewhere. And then medication wise. So there's a couple different options. There'a monthly chewable that will run. Let's see. So she's a lab, so probably around like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a [DURATION]. Now you can buy it on a monthly basis or you can get like [DURATION] [DURATION] at a time, [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. There is also an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for [DRUG] [DRUG] that covers for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. That one's a little bit. It costs about the same as doing like [DURATION] [DURATION] of the chewables, and it would kind of depend on how much they weighed. Okay. We'd probably do the twow of able. Okay. So I think she's around [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. So you're saying that the exam would be like [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [PERSON_NAME] and then like, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on how many months. If we got like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] worth of those. Is that what we're. Yeah. Is the othero [PERSON_NAME]? No, [PERSON_NAME] passed away. So this one is [PERSON_NAME]. So she is a [NATIONALITY] shepherd. She just turned [PERSON_AGE]. All right. Because I have a [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME], so I'll get that changed in our system as well. So yeah, it would be basically the exam, [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], and then the chewables. As long as you bring in like [DRUG] [DRUG] history. Okay. And I'll have to double check. I don't. I mean, I don't think [PERSON_NAME] is up on her [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. So what would that cost if we needed to get that done? I think the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay. All Right. O. So about. And that'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT] for both dogs for the exam and then the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and then the [DRUG]. Right. It'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the exam and the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. And then the [DRUG] would be additional. So, yeah, if you got like, let me look here because they're both probably the size range goes from [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm guessing they're both in there. So those are [MONEY_AMOUNT] per tablets. So per [DURATION]. Okay. Okay, perfect. Al rightty. Well, let me talk that over with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I'll let you guys know. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. || Good afternoon. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, is this [PERSON_NAME]? No, this is [PERSON_NAME]. O Hi [PERSON_NAME].

When you do screenshot it just let me know if you have any issues with your other office and I will also call them to try to get them as well. Yeah, I don't think like. I mean I've been at this place for a long time, but actually Canyon closer to home anyway for me. So it. And it was the [LOCATION] location you were at, right? Yeah, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, perfect. Just so I have the right one just in case. Okay, awesome. I'll send you this off momentarily. We're looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday for that [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and check up with [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, great. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks [PERSON_NAME]. Have a wonderful [DURATION]. Yes, you as well. Bye now. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I direct your call? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm a new person calling. I've never called you guys. I just looked you up in our insurance and I'm calling. Great. My son, we're actually building a house in [LOCATION]. We live in [LOCATION] right now. But my son is coming home from college and he called and asked me to make him an appointment for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But obviously he's not a patient. Ve so he's proably need an exam and whatnot. But he's only going to be here for the [DURATION] of the [DATE], and then he goes back to school for summer school. And I just want to know if you might have anything available while he's here the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. Well, he comes in on the [DATE], so he would have the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]. And he had two appointments. He needed a [OCCUPATION] and a [OCCUPATION] appointment for his ear. And I booked that at [TIME] on the [DATE]. But I can do anything else around that in the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. Sure, [PERSON_NAME], so we'd love to have you. We are booking out further than that, I think. But we can, if you like, put you on a waiting list and if something opens up, possibly get you sooner. Okay. What's your son's name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Is your name [PERSON_NAME]? I see it here on the caller idon y. I need to get you with our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Her name is [PERSON_NAME] and she'left for the [DURATION], but I can have her give you a call back, if that's okay. Sure. Our office opens again Monday, so [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], so we could get you in, get you verified, and get you on that next available list. And pop_ibly get an appointment that early, but it would just depend on a lot. Okay, well, what do you think the chances are? Not that good, because I might just like when he's home, you know, for the holidays or something, maybe start a new thing. But he really needs a [MEDICAL_PROCESS], so I only have that. Otherwise he's not going toa be home again till probably the fall, so. So let me get you over to [PERSON_NAME]. I think she's already left, but. Yeah, she's already left. Well, she can call me and if it works out fine. But I might, you know, I might still have to call around if he's on a waiting list, because I only have that Window of time that he's here. Want that date that he's here. Said it's the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. He's going to be here the [DATE], the [DATE] to [DATE] and [DATE] because you guys are not open on the weekends. Right? Right. Okay. And then he had another [OCCUPATION] appointment that he needed. So I have the one appointment booked on the [DATE] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. But I have anything before that, around that, after that and the rest of the [DURATION], [DATE] may open wide open for him to come anytime he can get in. Okay. I'm writing all this down to give to her. And then is he just needing in for the checkup and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or is there any like pain or any concerns and yeah, he doesn't have anything. He definitely hasn't been for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] since [MEDICAL_CONDITION] I'm sure being away at school he hasn't, but he has. Luckily we have a pretty. The genetics in our family are pretty good. I don't think are my kids have even had a [INJURY]. He had braces when he was in high school. Okay, so he just really wants the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is all he's asking for. I mean obviously I know he needs to exam but I mean that'what he. That's the purpose, not because he's having a problem. Okay. Just so [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and is F number the correct number to call you back on? Yeah. And then like I said, I found you guys in our insurance and we are [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. I know we have lots of patients with [ORGANIZATION]. If you have the subscriber ID and group number handy, I can take that down too. Maybe make. I can get it if you can hold on. I don't have it in front of me, but I can get it. Yeah, absolutely. I'll hold in my wallet. Actually, you know what? I think I don't have it exact because we don't get a card for that. It's under our blue closs per shield. So would it be the same number? I don't have a separate card for [OCCUPATION] for [DRUG]. You don't get a card for that. Okay. I think you look it up by I mean I can give you the employer. I mean when I do like the vision the same thing. We don't have a card for that. Usually when I have patients that have [DRUG], they log into their app to get the subscriber group number. I'm not sure that it's the same card as I don't use the app for it, but I do have. I mean, I do have an ID number for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] GroupW Shield and a group number and then the [OCCUPATION] coverages through that. You know, under that we don't have card I have for us. I'll take that down just in case it's a PPO. Okay, so the ID number, it's letters first. Okay, so [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Then [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay, so I have [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] no [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Perfect. Yep. And the group number is [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. What's after that? [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Correct. Okay, I'm going to give all this information to our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and then she can give you a call Monday when our office opens back up. [PERSON_NAME]. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Of course. Thank you."

Do you offer overnight boarding for dogs? Yes, you do, ma'am. And do you have a room for new patients or new bog Just coming weekend. This weekend? Yes. Let me see. Do you have dates for me? Yes. So it would be the [DATE] through the [DATE]. Yes, it looks like we have room. But we will have to do an evaluation and we also will have to have you make a profile for your pup. Okay, so if you go to the [ORGANIZATION] website, you're going to hit book now and you're going to create an account for your pup and you're going to upload their vaccines and there's a health care agree that we need to to sign and then after that we can get you set up for that evaluation. Okay, and how much is it per [DURATION] [DURATION]. So how it works, if you would pay for your you would pay for the room. So we have the option between luxury and classes. Our luxury suite are [MONEY_AMOUNT] and our Plic Sueets are [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then on top of that you would pay for play time. Okay, and how much is play time? So we have three play time options. We have our $[MONEY_AMOUNT] option which is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], so [DURATION] [DURATION] of play. And then we have a silver play time which is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. And you get extended checkout until [TIME] and then $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], which is our full care package, is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of stay, so [DURATION] [DURATION]. And you also receive a picture of your pup and you also get an extended checkout until [TIME] okay, and so if I'm getting back in town on Sunday, what time would I need to come pick her up? You just need to pick her out before [TIME] okay, so if I am coming into town to [LOCATION] and I just came to pick her up Monday morning instead, would I be charged like another [DURATION] [DURATION]? It depends what time on Monday you pick her up. Okay. Would I get a quote like once I fill it out on the website? Yeah, once you create that account, we can do a. We can make a reservation and at the end of that I can give you an estimate. Oay. And then you would like to that you just need to create the account. Okay, Ill ll go ahead and make an account. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Call back if you have any other questions. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I help you? Hi there. I want to go ahead and get a reservation down. I might need to modify it, but I want to go ahead and get it on the book. And my dog's name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what is your last name? My last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I just want to make sure I have the right one. No, absolutely. If there's another [PERSON_NAME], I would not want that. Okay, and what kind of reservation would you like? So it's going to be overnight for quite a [DURATION] [DURATION]. Not [DURATION], but overnight. And when were you looking to book? So I would drop her [DATE] [DATE], which is a Sunday, and I would pick her up on [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. Team. Okay, that has no problem. And could you remind me what's the most basic? I want to make sure she gets a ton of play time while I'm gone. That's always my goal. So what's the cheapest one for the overnight? Those packages, that would be our classic suite. Okay, can you. So sorry, can you. I forget I've done these things before. But can you explain again what they get with the basics? Yes, ma'am. So if you get the classic suite, you can still get a different package. The one that. Yes, it's more extensive, but they would get [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play. And that's the gold. Because with the bronze W is the cheapest one. They only get one play session. Ah, okay. Oh, no, that's okay. Okay, so classic is she gets the room. The classic is the. So aside from the play times, what's the classic itself? Then again, I always get this confused all the time. Yeah, that's just the room. It's just basic room. Okay. Oh, yeah, the other ones, they have like a patio or something. Is that right? Yes, ma'am. Okay. No, she's fine with the basic. Like get her classic. But then what is the difference in price for [DURATION] [DURATION] play versus one play, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Let me go back. Give me one second. No problem. Take the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I see he's been here before, correct? Yeah, many times. Okay. And I have even some credits on file, but they're the [DURATION] ones. So you're not the overnight. Sorry about that. No, take your time. I'm actually creating an online. So the silver, which they have the [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play for the group is [MONEY_AMOUNT] on top of the room and that's [DURATION] [DURATION]. So like the classics, we have two $[MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and that's per [DURATION]. And then the gold is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. But they get the extra potty break. They still get the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. Oh, to the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does still give [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION] and the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION]. But the [MONEY_AMOUNT] has a few other things, is that right? Yes, ma'am. [MONEY_AMOUNT] and those things. Sorry. Okay, go ahead. A progress report which is like pictures and updates on how their stay is. And that's about it. Okay. Okay, so. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] sil. That would probably be two. Okay, so if I did keep this for her to have all they play, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then real quick, less than the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. What's the price for the T [DURATION]? Two play times or one playime? So the one play time would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is there a [DURATION] [DURATION] times or. No, that would be the silver. Would they get [DURATION] [DURATION] play time or they can do [DURATION] [DURATION] play? It just. It depends. Oh, interesting. Okay, that's interesting. So basically if I was to do that, I'm looking at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], is that correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Oh my gosh. Adds up. And then if I want to add in the nail clippings, I can tell you that. Correct. Let me see if you want to add in a nail clipping. Trying to see did you want the [OCCUPATION]. Done? The nail trim? The actually might do the other one where they save it down really good. That would probably be the dremel. It's like where they rounded out. Okay. Yeah. How much is that one? That's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then, and then the clipp thing is how much? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Can you add that on there? Because I know for sure she needs your nails done. Yeah, of course. Did you want both of them or just a nail trim? So for the nail trim. It. It'it'it. Just makes they sharper. Is that what it is? They don't. They don't round it out? Yes, ma'am. They just clip them. They don't round them? No, you could do both. Go ahead and do [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then my other question is how much is it? If the. How much fe is it? If she were to do some lessons? Do you have any less? I don't know if I want to do that. But do you have any lessons there that get added on? Any specials to get added on since it's still expensive? Let me see. So they would still be the same, like the same price O It wouldn't like give a discount or anything. It would just add on to the total at the end. Oh, okay. Okay. And then could you tell me what vaccine she's still in need of? Yes, ma'am. I had brought in paperwork to show she had one that was still good [DURATION] [DURATION] from the [OCCUPATION], but I don't know yet what would be the case. Yeah, of course. Did you want her to have like a.m. and p.m. play times or [DURATION] [DURATION]? Oh, definitely the [DURATION] [DURATION], yeah. Okay. And did you want that every [DURATION]? Every other [DURATION] I would put it. Let's put it down right now for every [DURATION]. Because my goal is that she so socialized this long time because she. She goes there, you know, she's obviously in the cloud, she with them. The problem though is that at home she's least reactive when I take her on walk. But at next [DURATION], you know, she does okay. Sometimes they bring her to the side, but you know, she's been able to be there [DURATION] [DURATION] when it comes to the playtime. And that's my goal is like to use this [DURATION] [DURATION] or of. For whatever long it is for her to be with dogs like the whole time. And I hope is it's gonna help her. Oh, I understand that. Give me one second. I'm trying to see about lodging. Okay. Sorry, I'm trying to reservation so I can check everything outse. Yeah, no problem. And you wanted to check on the vaccine? Yeah. What? God forbid. I got there, they're like, oh, she needs this and that. And then I'm like flying. I'm literally flying to [LOCATION]. Yeah, no, they're showing that they're all up to date. The only one that is about to expire is the [DRUG], which expires on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Awesome. I wouldn't you to get that before. Yes, ma'am. Okay, so border to. Are you guys doing any of the vaccine. You know, you guys do the vaccine thing in the parking lot? Yeah, they'll be here on the [DATE] from [TIME] to [TIME]. Okay, let me write that out on. Is it Sunday? Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'm gonna put that in here or to tell a Vacine. That way I have it and it's all done. Okay, that's. That's all. You know what time they're there on the [DATE]? [TIME] to [TIME] awesome. Okay. Is there anything else that I need to know right now? You don't charge the card or anything yet, right? In case I want to change this. Okay. I just want to'in there if you know if there's any special that [DURATION]. Like, I know I didn't do this, but it was [EVENT], I think. Like, you buy a pie, apple pie, something like. Is there any specials going on while she's there? I do not believe so, no, ma'am. But I think I'KNOW more around the time that she's coming in. Okay, that's good to know. Okay. All right. This is great. Thank you so much. I'm glad that I'm down. And then I. I'll circle back on anything I need to change. Yes, ma'am. And I have her down for the [DATE] through the [DATE]. Yeah. So my question actually is if I pick her up. I've done this before. Like, when I picked her up on the. Like, say that that Friday more. They didn't charge me for that Friday. If I did it by a certain time, they just charge me through Thursday. What's that time again? [TIME]. [TIME]. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. At least'save some money. Awesome. Okay, well, thank you so very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. You have a wonderful [DURATION]. You as well. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi. I wouldn just check in and to see what it would be to get my two dogs on like a [DRUG] [DRUG]. [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]. Have we seen the pets before? Youve seen one of them, but not the other. Okay. What's your last [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME] is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and the pets name_cy and we kind of like. I know that she may not sure that she's up to date on shop there, but we've been going other places and so we're just trying to get them on this since we're going to be out camping and things like that. Okay, let me look here. So in order to dispense any meds, we do have to do like a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So that [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that we do prior to starting is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that would be just the exam and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], assuming that [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is current, which you said that you had elsewhere. And then medication wise. So there's a couple different options. There'a monthly chewable that will run. Let's see. So she's a lab, so probably around like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a [DURATION]. Now you can buy it on a monthly basis or you can get like [DURATION] [DURATION] at a time, [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. There is also an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for [DRUG] [DRUG] that covers for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. That one's a little bit. It costs about the same as doing like [DURATION] [DURATION] of the chewables, and it would kind of depend on how much they weighed. Okay. We'd probably do the twow of able. Okay. So I think she's around [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. So you're saying that the exam would be like [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [PERSON_NAME] and then like, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on how many months. If we got like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] worth of those. Is that what we're. Yeah. Is the othero [PERSON_NAME]? No, [PERSON_NAME] passed away. So this one is [PERSON_NAME]. So she is a [NATIONALITY] shepherd. She just turned [PERSON_AGE]. All right. Because I have a [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME], so I'll get that changed in our system as well. So yeah, it would be basically the exam, [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], and then the chewables. As long as you bring in like [DRUG] [DRUG] history. Okay. And I'll have to double check. I don't. I mean, I don't think [PERSON_NAME] is up on her [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. So what would that cost if we needed to get that done? I think the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay. All Right. O. So about. And that'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT] for both dogs for the exam and then the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and then the [DRUG]. Right. It'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the exam and the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. And then the [DRUG] would be additional. So, yeah, if you got like, let me look here because they're both probably the size range goes from [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm guessing they're both in there. So those are [MONEY_AMOUNT] per tablets. So per [DURATION]. Okay. Okay, perfect. Al rightty. Well, let me talk that over with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I'll let you guys know. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. || Good afternoon. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, is this [PERSON_NAME]? No, this is [PERSON_NAME]. O Hi [PERSON_NAME].

What about later on the Monday? What about a [TIME] [TIME]? No, Monday is a terrible [DURATION] for me. O okay. I have an opening. So [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] is here on Tuesday. What about Tuesday? I have a [TIME] on this [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. Correct. Is that our only opening that [DURATION]? Correct.AppleX because in between.

So two things will happen. Number one, they are going to have you sign an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] release. I actually going to send you an email that will have our new patient forms in there and one of the forms is that [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] release that you have to give permission to do it or if you contact them directly, they will send them over if you you give them permission to do so. [PHONE_NUMBER]. I'm going to contact them directly to cancel this appointment. Why not? Anyway, perfect. And then can I give you our email so you can have them just send it to us? [PHONE_NUMBER].

When you do screenshot it just let me know if you have any issues with your other office and I will also call them to try to get them as well. Yeah, I don't think like. I mean I've been at this place for a long time, but actually Canyon closer to home anyway for me. So it. And it was the [LOCATION] location you were at, right? Yeah, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, perfect. Just so I have the right one just in case. Okay, awesome. I'll send you this off momentarily. We're looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday for that [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and check up with [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, great. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks [PERSON_NAME]. Have a wonderful [DURATION]. Yes, you as well. Bye now. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I direct your call? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm a new person calling. I've never called you guys. I just looked you up in our insurance and I'm calling. Great. My son, we're actually building a house in [LOCATION]. We live in [LOCATION] right now. But my son is coming home from college and he called and asked me to make him an appointment for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But obviously he's not a patient. Ve so he's proably need an exam and whatnot. But he's only going to be here for the [DURATION] of the [DATE], and then he goes back to school for summer school. And I just want to know if you might have anything available while he's here the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. Well, he comes in on the [DATE], so he would have the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]. And he had two appointments. He needed a [OCCUPATION] and a [OCCUPATION] appointment for his ear. And I booked that at [TIME] on the [DATE]. But I can do anything else around that in the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. Sure, [PERSON_NAME], so we'd love to have you. We are booking out further than that, I think. But we can, if you like, put you on a waiting list and if something opens up, possibly get you sooner. Okay. What's your son's name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Is your name [PERSON_NAME]? I see it here on the caller idon y. I need to get you with our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Her name is [PERSON_NAME] and she'left for the [DURATION], but I can have her give you a call back, if that's okay. Sure. Our office opens again Monday, so [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], so we could get you in, get you verified, and get you on that next available list. And pop_ibly get an appointment that early, but it would just depend on a lot. Okay, well, what do you think the chances are? Not that good, because I might just like when he's home, you know, for the holidays or something, maybe start a new thing. But he really needs a [MEDICAL_PROCESS], so I only have that. Otherwise he's not going toa be home again till probably the fall, so. So let me get you over to [PERSON_NAME]. I think she's already left, but. Yeah, she's already left. Well, she can call me and if it works out fine. But I might, you know, I might still have to call around if he's on a waiting list, because I only have that Window of time that he's here. Want that date that he's here. Said it's the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. He's going to be here the [DATE], the [DATE] to [DATE] and [DATE] because you guys are not open on the weekends. Right? Right. Okay. And then he had another [OCCUPATION] appointment that he needed. So I have the one appointment booked on the [DATE] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. But I have anything before that, around that, after that and the rest of the [DURATION], [DATE] may open wide open for him to come anytime he can get in. Okay. I'm writing all this down to give to her. And then is he just needing in for the checkup and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or is there any like pain or any concerns and yeah, he doesn't have anything. He definitely hasn't been for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] since [MEDICAL_CONDITION] I'm sure being away at school he hasn't, but he has. Luckily we have a pretty. The genetics in our family are pretty good. I don't think are my kids have even had a [INJURY]. He had braces when he was in high school. Okay, so he just really wants the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is all he's asking for. I mean obviously I know he needs to exam but I mean that'what he. That's the purpose, not because he's having a problem. Okay. Just so [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and is F number the correct number to call you back on? Yeah. And then like I said, I found you guys in our insurance and we are [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. I know we have lots of patients with [ORGANIZATION]. If you have the subscriber ID and group number handy, I can take that down too. Maybe make. I can get it if you can hold on. I don't have it in front of me, but I can get it. Yeah, absolutely. I'll hold in my wallet. Actually, you know what? I think I don't have it exact because we don't get a card for that. It's under our blue closs per shield. So would it be the same number? I don't have a separate card for [OCCUPATION] for [DRUG]. You don't get a card for that. Okay. I think you look it up by I mean I can give you the employer. I mean when I do like the vision the same thing. We don't have a card for that. Usually when I have patients that have [DRUG], they log into their app to get the subscriber group number. I'm not sure that it's the same card as I don't use the app for it, but I do have. I mean, I do have an ID number for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] GroupW Shield and a group number and then the [OCCUPATION] coverages through that. You know, under that we don't have card I have for us. I'll take that down just in case it's a PPO. Okay, so the ID number, it's letters first. Okay, so [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Then [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay, so I have [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] no [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Perfect. Yep. And the group number is [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. What's after that? [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Correct. Okay, I'm going to give all this information to our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and then she can give you a call Monday when our office opens back up. [PERSON_NAME]. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Of course. Thank you."

[ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Good morning. I have a question. I'm just calling my daughter [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. She was referred by your office to [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] to get her [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But she'just's been a little while right now. So we haven't been able to come into the [OCCUPATION] because of insurance purposes to able to cover the whole procedure. But she's just kind of wondering if you guys are able to get. She's just kind of questioning it. She should do this. If she could get from your records why she was referred to [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] to [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. I mean, theonultation that she got [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] was basically just to say yes, go ahead. But it was the laughter and [OCCUPATION] that referred her to it. Does that make sense? A little bit, yeah. Yeah. She's around the age where you're supposed to [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Let me see if there's any notes. Yeah, there's no notes on that from her last appointment. I know we did refer her. It was probably just a recommendation. And if it is a recommendation, [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] says we can't do it here. Then we'll refer to the specialist. Yeah, we just want to know the reasons why she got referred. Because they can't do the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] here for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. No. Yes, but usually if [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], there's a reason for it, right? Everyone because they perfect [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Usually. O not for my understanding. Is there any way that that [OCCUPATION] could give me a call then? Because everyone should. I mean, I didn't get a referral from my other daughter. She's a twin. They told her they were perfectly fine. So that's why I. We just kind of. We're just a bit confused and see this reason why. So it's notnna be the same as your other daughter. Maybe, yeah. So can you give me the reasons to why [PERSON_NAME] got referred then? So if everyone's different, everybody gets the pearls. Not everybody has to [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So we just want to know exactly the reason. But maybe later on. But yeah, I'll tell [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] to give you a call. No worries. Yeah, that would be better because I'm just getting a guess here from you. I mean, I'd rather just get a [OCCUPATION] to call me then it's definitely not a guess. But I'll tell her to give you a call. I'm sorry, are you arguing with me? No. I'll tell her to give you a call. The phone. It's [PERSON_NAME]. Yeah, [PERSON_NAME], I've had the same problem with you many times. Many times you have. You have. Listen to me. You have a tendency to argue on the phone. And you did this to me about [DURATION] [DURATION] ago and I had to talk to you. And I don't appreciate how you come across to your customers. I put a complaint on you and they had to speak to you. So here's my thing, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm not getting answers from you. So I'm asking from someone, a professional that deals with my daughter's teet to answer this for me. If you're not seeing the notes, then I'm not sure why not were'put to an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] to be done. I'm asking for medical medical language here. Not. It's not a guess and it's not it. She's at the age should be done. I get that you have a procedure where you should go through, but it's just how you argue on the phone. [PERSON_NAME], I'm not here to call and argue. I'm actually calling because I have to pay this for my daughter. Right? So getting that kind of answer doesn't justify it. Okay. I apologize about that and I respect that. And I'll tell [OCCUPATION]. Dad to give you a call. Thank you. Okay, you. Thank you. Oay. Bye. Bye. Okay, bye. || [PERSON_NAME]. Ms. [PERSON_NAME], this [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Yes, may I speak with [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] please? Can I let her know who's calling what? This is in regards [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I spoke with her this morning regarding a crown. She's the [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] that submitted a preau authorization. Oh, okay. Let me see if she's available. You said [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]? Yes, I. A brief hold. Thank you. At [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], our patients walk in with a grin and out with a smile. Our mission is to provide you and your family high quality patient care and education in a safe, friendly environment by our knowledgeable and well trained team. Weive. Thank you for holding, Mrs. [PERSON_NAME]. Hi, this is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Hi. I spoke with you this morning regarding the preau authorization of my crown. And you sent the email. Sent me an email on that from [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and then I had a chance to call them and ``ak with some of their [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] to explain, you know, what they are paying and what they're not paying. And it looks like it's costing more because the benefit only covers the metal and I would want white and so. So they're downgrading it. Yeah, yeah, so I understand that part. But then she said it's number that's alsoied. They denied the fact that 50% of the tooth is not there and that she said you don't need the build up because the tooth would support that. And I said, well, somebody's right and somebody's wrong. And she said, well I'm looking at the picture and I can see that there is a lot of tooth there. And I go well then we would need to appeal it. You mentioned doing a picture like when we're doing. Yeah's obvious's worse because they can't do an instant, you know. I said well, how would that work? Can we get a direct line to you? Can I have my mouth open and you guys argue it out? I don't think that's possible. And she's like no, that wouldn't work. So. And she goes, and if it's ground [MEDICAL_PROCESS], she's like that's a sticky situation. That you have plenty of tooth there. And then they [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. And I go okay, well. And so then I was thinking, I've had this situation happen before. And she said the same thing, that the [OCCUPATION] rights, you know, that they appeal it. Yeah. And so can we do that to see. I mean if it doesn't need to be done then maybe I could go ahead with the crown and not have the build up, or if it does need to be done, maybe the [OCCUPATION] can, you know, discuss and they'll get another [OCCUPATION]. You know, I don't see the issue is here. Like the crown that was proposed to you, you have that [INJURY] [INJURY] [INJURY] [INJURY]. So as soon as she starts [MEDICAL_PROCESS], that can just [INJURY] [INJURY] [INJURY]. And then you don't have the tooth structures. So I'm not sure from a dental standpoint where they. Where they gather their information, but I mean, we can always var. Yeah, yeah. And so I will send an email to my coworker here and then we'll have [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] write a narrative and we'll try to resend that for you and see if they take that. Because we did send like all the pictures and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that we could. So we'll try that and see if that works. She did not mention that [INJURY] at all. So I don't think they were looking at it. Yeah, it just seem. Sometimes I feel like they will kind of whittle their way around making payment over things when, as the [OCCUPATION] is seeing your tooth, I mean, they're going off of their medical findings that, you know, they have knowledge of. So. So I would say that's the best bet is I will let the [OCCUPATION] make a narrative and we'll resubmit that for you. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. All right, you're welcome. We'll be in touch. Okay, bye. Bye. Thank you. Bye. || Thank you for selecting [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I help you? Who'here [PERSON_NAME]. Hi [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I thought that's what you said, but I. I didn't hear you for sure. Hi [PERSON_NAME], how are you? I need order contact. Okay, we can do that. Give me just a moment here to pull you up. How are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. It's a little whileild around here today, but you know. Is it. No complaints. Want to 'not that big a deal. Yeah. Oh no, my computer is kicking me out so if you bear with me for a second. So have you gotten out to see the new grandbaby again? I'm going in another week. O exciting. I know. To never get enough of those babies snuggles. I know, right? It's so much better being the grandma. Bet it is. It really is. All right. Are we using any insurance for you? I think that I used all of my insurance when I got my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] in my glasses. So I think I have to pay for these contacts. Okay. All right. Now she has two different prescriptions in here for you. Did you like the stronger one? Actually, you know, it's a real toss up but I think in order to be able to see far away also I should just stick with a 2.5 for now. Okay. And then if I notice I can't see as well again, I can always get the 2.75 but for now I think just order the 2.5. Okay, sounds great. And Os, what am I doing here? How much of us appl did you want to order? Give me options. [DURATION] [DURATION]. Ye, you got [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION]. And you can do, you know as many packs you said ninetyever. Yeah. Okay. Did you want that ship to [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION]? Is there a cost for it or I'll just pick it up. No cost. Oh, all right. Yeah, that's handy. Okay, awesome. We'll go ahead and ship them to you. And let me just get over to the credit card machine. It's [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]. [CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER]. Okay. You can go ahead whenever you're ready. Looking for. All right, here we go. This is a Visa. Okay. And the expiration date? All right, perfect. You should see these within [DURATION] [DURATION]. Thank you. I hope you. Thank you. Thank you so much. It was good. It's good to talk to you too. By. || H have a [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. Hi. I have one of your mailers. Your mailer cards. Yeah, yeah. For a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Absolutely. I'assuming youre a new patient, [PERSON_NAME]? I am. I would be, yes. Yes. Far. How far out? How far out are you guys in scheduling next [DURATION]? Thats not very far enough. Okay. We try to make sure we reserving times for our new patients. So let me see here. Lets grab some information. Just so you know, that flyer covers two separate appointments. So the first appointment that well schedule right now is a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] with the [OCCUPATION]. And then at that time Il go over any recommendations about which type of [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. And then we will get you scheduled with a [OCCUPATION], usually on a different date. If they have time that [DURATION], they will definitely do it. But because its two different people. But that [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] covers all of it. So you wont have to pay that tw or anything. Just like to give people a heads up that its probably not going to happen the same [DURATION]. But were definitely going to schedule the exam and we will get you scheduled back for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Okay. Because the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is what I'm really, really wanting. But I figure [MONEY_AMOUNT] get the rest the whole [PERSON_NAME] and that will get you allup and that will get you all established here too. That way if you have any issues later on down the line, you just pop right in. Right. Okay. So I payid the $[MONEY_AMOUNT] after the first visit. Yep. And then you'll get the free technically a free [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that technically covers that exam and whatnot to get established for the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] freef. So you wont have to pay anything at the next date. Cool. All right, let's grab some information. What is your first name, last name? First name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Perfect. Good. Phone number for you, [PERSON_NAME]. Awesome. And your address? [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] [LOCATION] Zip is [LOCATION]. [LOCATION]. Perfect. And your date of birth? [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. And are you required to take [DRUG] prior to dental visits, usually with any [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]? No. Perfect. Give me just one second here. Im going to get this patient that just walked in checked in. Okay? Sure. Alrighty. Thanks for being patient. O and seeing as we're going with that $[MONEY_AMOUNT] mailer, I'm assuming we don't have dental insurance, correct? That is correct. Not at this time. That's okay. We always like to ask and when was your last dental Visit. Oh, it's been a while. It' been, I want to say probably [DURATION] [DURATION]. [DURATION] [DURATION]. That's all. Right. Was there anything that you particularly liked or disliked about that visit or the team, just so we know how to make you more comfortable? No, I'm not real. Like, I'm not like a scary person, a scared person. The only thing I didn't like about that visit is he freaking replaced the of the silver fillings that I had with white ones. And it was really annoying because I couldn't chew or bite or anything on that side for pretty much the whole [DURATION] [DURATION]. I just now started to feel comfortable chewing on that side, but that was about it. I don't think they ever did my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] like they. Like they said they were going to, which is why I'm in. Yeah, of course. You know, I was going to that office [DURATION] [DURATION] and the owner ended up. He still owned it, but he left it to another [OCCUPATION]. Went down. It kind of went downhill after that. O that's hard. Especially when you're at of place for so long and then it changes owners and everything just goes awry. Yeah, that wasn't very cool that I didn't at least get my [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. I like my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] because usually by brushing half the [DURATION], my teeth already feel like they need another brushing. So I really need that. Right. But otherwise I'm cool. I'm pretty cool about, you know, what you guys got to do. Yeah. Yeah. So other than the [MEDICAL_PROCESS], do you have any other concerns that's going on with your teeth? I mean, bleeding? Not really. Not really. Some sensitivity to cold, but I'm using a different toothpaste for that. I thought I'd try, you know, sun ofine. Yeah, I actually use it fin Ye O yeah. Other than just a little of sensitivity now and then, have nothing. I have no complaints with my teeth. Okay, perfect. Don'do. You prefer mornings or afternoons? Let's get you in next [DURATION]. Or is there a. Would be like an early afternoon maybe? Yeah. Do we want to do. Excuse me. I've got a [TIME] with a [TIME] check in. Okay. And what [DURATION] was that? Let. Okay. I thought you already said the date. I snee so I thought I missed some of our conversation. No, you're okay. Tuesday. Tuesday. Ye let's do it. Okay, let's do it. I like it. Okay. D. I've got you in for [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME] with a [TIME] check in. And that's just to fill out the paperwork. You are more than welcome to swing by anytime before then and just pick it up. You dont have to wait in line. If youd rather do it at home, just wave us down and be like hey, I just need a new patient packet. Or you can also print them off on our website. So you got a couple options if you dont want to come earlier that [DURATION]. Okay. If Im in the area, Ill definitely stop by. But if I for you today. But were here till [TIME] [TIME] on Monday. Oh, later on Monday. Okay, perfect. So I'll see you Tuesday. I'm sorry, [TIME] check in. You got it. And then do you need this card that I have this mailer. Yeah, go ahead and bring that in. Okay, I'll bring it. Awesome. The name was [PERSON_NAME]. Like the color [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, awesome. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. Thank you, [PERSON_NAME]. I will see you on Tuesday. All right. Have a good weekend. Bye now too. || [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME]. How may I assist you? Yes, I would like to book a grooming appointment for [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. For a haircut or just the bath? Just a bath all. Is this for [PERSON_NAME]? Yes. All right. You guys will just have to check in before [TIME] [TIME]. [TIME]. okay, go ahead. No, you. I. I was going to say, have you all been received any complaints about booking on your website? We've always had complaints. As far as grooming, it's usually always best to call because our grooming, our groomer'schedules are very sporadic and we have like. The system doesn't always have the right like slots or days put in properly. But the client side of the system has never been user friendly and our system has been extremely slow since it updated the other week. And so everybody, even us have been having issues with it. Okay. Because I usually book through the website but lately I've been getting this error. I've tried a few times in the past [DURATION] [DURATION] and I've gotten some error. It'll say you must sign the proper agreement, something of that sort. And. And then there's one more error message but I know that's one of them and I'm like, what is going on? Sod. Let me check your account. Because the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] came in the other week and they did make an update for back in [DATE_INTERVAL] that the agreements, like the policy and procedure agreements that you guys had signed online renews every year. So that's probably what that is. And it does look like that your agreement signature needs to be updated. So that's probably why it was trying to say that there was an error. But yeah, no, you guys will be all set and we'll have you guys sign that when you check in. That way everything should be up to date and it should work from your end at least as far as getting rid of that error. But if you end up seeing the. I know you said that there was another error that you had seen. If you see that again, just let us know because our system has just been absolutely horrible. So we've just been struggling to deal with it. It's been pretty rough. Okay. Yeah. Like I said, I normally bookointintments online so I just didn't understand what was going on. I would do even know because sometimes you'll experience the customer experience issues and the facility be unaware of it because no one tells them. Yeah, exactly. I appreciate you at least telling us because sometimes we don't know of any possible issues. So it, yeah, this'just been horrible. It's been like this for [DURATION] [DURATION]. We're hoping that they just put out an update and it fixes itself. So we're just kind of sitting ducks right now, just kind of waiting to see what it decides likes to do. Okay, cool. But other than that, you guys are all set for [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Okay, cool. Well, thank you. No problem. You guys have a good one. Okay? You too. Bye."

Yes, sir. I mean yes, ma'am. Yeah. So I have you here in the schedule as a re eval probably because the [OCCUPATION] that is on that [DURATION] is not the same one who saw you the first time. But let me check something. Yeah, there was [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] and that's Wednesday. Okay, give me one second. Sorry. Okay, so let me check here. We prescribe you [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for tooth number It'two feet that need to be [MEDICAL_PROCESS] at the top. Right. Right side. Is that correct? Yes. So you want to get both [MEDICAL_PROCESS] down? Ye. Okay, so yeah, we can do the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] on Wednesday. And I also want to know how much is going to cost because I know that y'all for this piece in after the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. I don't want that. So without that, how much would both of the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] be? Oh, okay. Of course. So you want to know the prices for use the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]? No one. Yeah, I don't want the thing because I never had that before. I had [MEDICAL_PROCESS] before, but I never had them have to put a. Whatever that is in my mouth after the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. O Ye. I don't want that. That's a bone grass. It's like [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. That way if you. If you need the partial or something to replace your. Your [INJURY] [INJURY] and there's going to be like bone to hold the partial. But it's up to you. If you don't want [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] graphic, that's okay. We can just do the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Okay, and how much would that cost you? All right, give me one second. Let me check that. Okay, so it's going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT] for both of them. Okay, [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Thank you. Yes, of course. I'll see you here on Wednesday. And I ask you one question. How many pings I need. I don't want it done it there. I'm just asking. I know how much. You know what I'm looking at for that? Oh, yeah. Give me one second. Let me check that. So it's going to be [MONEY_AMOUNT] for all of them. These [MONEY_AMOUNT] filings in total. Six? Yeah, I have to get them all at one time? No, you can just get some of them first and then you can come back and just get the rest. So how much each of them is like. You see a feak each other is going to be like. It depends on the surface of the tooth. So I'm going to give you like an example. Okay. So all the feelings are at the bottom. For all. All of the feelings is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Know I'm saying all of the. Is at the bottom of my mouth. Oh, no, you need some of the right side, bottom and top. Right side. And some more others left side. You have. You have finings at the top and bottom. Left and right side. O this, for example, you can start with just one quadrant. I mean, you can start with your. For example, left. I mean right side at the bottom. You can start with them. There are two feelings there. So O we can do your. Your right side. You have two at the bottom and one at the top. That needs to be done. We can do it. And then we can do the left side. It's gonna be like maybe like one something for each one. You think so? Or less is less than that. Let me. I got. Yeah. Because if I got [MONEY_AMOUNT] something, you need [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT]. It should be a little lesser than a [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah. At least a little less. Yeah. It would depend on which one you need because some. Some feelings are like just one surface and another one have like seven short patients. Y. Why thank you for good with me. Everything to me so I will see y'all on the [DATE]. Is it okay that I take my [DRUG] [DRUG]? Because I'm terrified to get my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] because I had a bad experienceit. Okay. Yeahlo. Can you hear me? Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. The call was I couldn't hear. I was a oay. Sorry. I was asking, is it okay that I take my [DRUG] [DRUG] before I come Because I had a bad experience before I get my [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], and I'm going to be overwhelmed. I'm kind of terrified. In the last sentage I had, he was awesome as pulling seet. I didn't feel nothing. And. But before him, a woman had [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], and it felt like she was pulling. She didn't numb me up enough at all, and she felt like she was pulling my skull on my head, and she was constantly pulling. I'm started telling I'm feeling everything, and that terrified me. And I have. And I had found conf [OCCUPATION] in [LOCATION] [LOCATION] that that's why I'm from. He was awesome. I didn't feel. I didn't feel no pressure. I didn't feel nothing. That's how much he numb me up, you know, to make sure I didn't feel anything. So that's why I need to take. But that's why I have to take [DRUG] [DRUG] before I come, because I'm afraid. And then you allew. You know, I don't know how it's going to be. So that's why I'm asking, is it okay that I take my [DRUG] [DRUG] before I come? Yeah, I think you should be okay. You should be okay with that. So are you take. Are you taking [DRUG] [DRUG]? No. No. Okay. You have, like, [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] or something? Yeah, I take my [DRUG] [DRUG]. Ever did. All right, just make sure before you come that you take your medication, because if you have. If your [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION], we cannot do any procedure. You know what I'm saying? It's like if your [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION] [MEDICAL_CONDITION], we have a risk for bleeding or anything. So I was supposed to get prior authorization from my [OCCUPATION], and I can't. Um, Is it any way y'all can f the paper to. Because I don't even have a. I don't know know what I deal with the people. We can ask the [OCCUPATION] once you here. I. We can ask her. Hello? Yeah, I'm listening. Oh, okay. So, yeah, about your medication. You can ask. We can ask the [OCCUPATION] once you're here, but it's gonna be. It's gonna be okay. I mean, if you are not taking the medication that I'm telling you, [DRUG] [DRUG]. It's going to be okay. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Yes, of course. I'SEE you here. Okay, bye. || So [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], this is [PERSON_NAME], how may help you? Hi, I was wondering do you have any appointments for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] this [DURATION]? Sure. Are you a current patient or new patient? This is a new patient. I'm looking for an appointment for my [MARITAL_STATUS], but I go to the [OCCUPATION] like you twice or [DATE_OF_BIRTH] times [DURATION] [DURATION]. But he does not like going to the [OCCUPATION] so I'm trying to get him in. He has dental insurance through his work [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] and so I was trying to figure out if you guys had any time and then like with his insurance, how much you would have to pay. Okay, so definitely I can help out you. Sorry, help you out to schedule for your [MARITAL_STATUS]. So first in order, our [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] would need to check the benefits as well. I can do a pre authorization kind of see what is coverage looking like. But first I would need to schedule the appointment and then we can move forward with you taking the benefits and so on and so forth. Does he prefer morning or afternoon? I don't think he has a preference Per depend on. I know sometimes like it depends on like on Tuesday it might be better [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] because I know you use things to do [TIME] [TIME] afternoons. But overall it just depends on what you already have scheduled. Okay, so we have an opportunity Tomorrow, [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] at [TIME], [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. If that does not work for him after that there would be a opportunity. [DATE] [DATE] this Thursday at [TIME]. Do E of those work for him? I think either one will probably work for him. Does he want to come in tomorrow at [TIME]? [TIME]? I think so. Can I schedule and then call you back if that doesn't work? Is that okay? Ye. Yeah, definitely. And how did you guys hear about the office? Oh, I was googling different things actually. O okay, office. Let me grab his information. Can I have his first name please? His first name is [PERSON_NAME], which is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Last name. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Okay. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] His phone number. Let's see, he has like [DATE_OF_BIRTH] different phone numbers. So I'm trying to figure out what. Be the best you you can I just give my phone number right now. Sure. Okay. My phone number is. Okay. Birth. His birthday. His birth date is [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. I think it's. Let me. I think it's [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. Yeah, I have to think about that often. Let's see here. I think he's [DATE_OF_BIRTH] an [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. Let's see here. I think he's [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. Okay, I'pretty sure I just did the Math. That sounds okay. [DATE_OF_BIRTH]. Let me see here. So I'm going to schedule him. Does he want an exam as well? I think it depends on the cost of it and stuff like that. Schedule for both and then let me depending on what you guys decide. Okay. Wait, does the cost do [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], does he have any recent [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that he's taken [TIME] [TIME] last year? No, because he hates going to the [OCCUPATION]. So I'm like, I't want to, like, I don't want to overdo it where he gets overwhelmed. So I'I definitely. We definitely want to [MEDICAL_PROCESS] but I don't know, other stuff might overwhelm. I'm trying to ease them into going to the [OCCUPATION]. Okay, so then we'll just start off with the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and then we can schedule the exam another day. See, I have you on the phone. Let me look at his plan if I'm able to locate it. Do you have his member ID by any chance? Yes, I do have his card. Okay. Yes. Enrolling ID number is [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Do you need the group ID? No. Okay, I found his active coverage. All right. So it actually looks like this preventative services are covered 100%. Okay. Still active. Oh, does that include also if we get the whatever the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or whatever assessment from the thing, is that covered too? Sorry, [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. I mean, you know when you have the [OCCUPATION] look at your teeth and give you an assessment of whatever. Like an evaluation? Yeah, whatever. Yes. My God, that's preventvent. It's preventative services basically. So [MEDICAL_PROCESS], [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] are fallt under preventative services, which it looks like based off his plan is covered at 100%. I can always preauth authorize as well. Just so it gives you so we can clarify that. Okay. So everything that we could do tomorrow would be covered by his insurance based off what I'm looking at? Yes. But I could always do a pre authorization and I can text you or email you the estimate or let you know. Okay. Did you want to. Did you want to hold off on scheduling that exam? Let's do it. I'm going to call him soon. They got the phone and I'll see if I can. We can smooth that over and it will be oay. So let's schedule that. Ok. All right, perfect. And may I have your name? My name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. And you have my phone number. So anything you send me all forward to him, I'm going to call and talk to him and I want to make sure I have the. You said tomorrow at [TIME], is that correct? Yes. Tomorrow at [TIME]. [TIME]. And I can text you a new patient form so we can fill those out beforehand. Okay, that would be great. That would be awesome. All right, [PERSON_NAME], let me work on that, and then I'll let you know if there'a cool payment or not. Okay, thank you so much. All right, thanks.

Do you have [DURATION] quick question or just need to confirm or cancel an appointment? You can text us. You can reach our [LOCATION] office via text by just sending your text message to our main le the [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME], how may I help you? Oh, hi. I had [DURATION] couple of questions. I was wondering how do you become [DURATION] new patient? Please? Sure. Yeah. I mean far it is pretty simple. I just get your name and information we askvious you want to go to and then we will get you in for an exam and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Like an initial new patient exam and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] to get you established. Is that something you'd be interested in setting up? It is. Can I ask you [DURATION] question? Y. So can you just be honest with me? So I'm leaving the [OCCUPATION] I've been with for like [DURATION] [DURATION], their billing is an absolute nightmare. Like every time you turn around it's either twice as high as what they estimate or they get the money and then they hang on to it and you have [DURATION] hard time getting like the extra payments back. Are you guys pretty good with your billing? Like with the dental? Like when you give an estimate, does the estimates come out pretty accurate? Yeah, as far as I know. What's your insurance? Because it really depends on the insurance too. So we have [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. Is it [DURATION] ppo? It is [DURATION] ppo. Okay, I'm pretty sure those are pretty good. I know sometimes with the like [ORGANIZATION] and blue pressust [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. So sometimes it won't show like the in network write off. Because [ORGANIZATION] is one that we are in network with. So it might not estimate. Those usually know it s kind of [DURATION] good thing. It ends up coming back paying more than what we estimate'get Once we have the claims all set, we refund you for whatever is left over. So we won't hold on to anything like that. You know, of course if we're waiting on claims, but typically with those we have pretty accurate estimates. And at least on the insurance side, what they would cover and then we can even send three authorizations if you want further estimates just to make sure. Okay. All right. And then can I ask you, so how does it work? So like if the estimate is way off, is the patient still responsible for it? Yes. I mean they are estimates. When we show you [DURATION] treatment plan, it does say on there is an estimate based on the information that the insurance company gives us. And then that's why we'll do you would like and an additional pre authorization because it [DURATION] little bit. It's still an estimate but it's [DURATION] little bit more accurate because we sen the information what procedures are being done to the insurance rather than just taking the percentage based on frequency limitations and procedure codes. Okay, so then what I just ask like the current [OCCUPATION] to forward over my record so I could figure out my next [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and everything is. Yeah, definitely. I will say if you want to schedule [DURATION] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] with us, we are booking into [DATE_INTERVAL] just to give you [DURATION] heads up. Of course, if you're having [DURATION] concern for [DURATION] [OCCUPATION], those aren't looking at as far I think [DURATION] lot of our [OCCUPATION], at least at the [LOCATION] [OCCUPATION] are looking at [DATE_INTERVAL] time. And then if you want to start with the exam and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] first and kind of speed up the process of getting you in for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] as well because sometimes we see cancellations. I see. Well, I wanted to figure out what the insurance, I guess what I get like two [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [DURATION] year or whatever it is. So invest [LOCATION]. You can get in [DURATION] little sooner than you can in [LOCATION]. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I mean to be honest, we have more providers here and the bigger office. So honestly, you're probably looking at [DURATION] quicker time to get an appointment over at our best office. But we'll work with you, whatever office you want to go to and get your information over there. And you can also go between offices. Okay, perfect. So what I'll do is I'll start working getting the information over to you guys then. Okay, yeah, sounds good. Did you want me to send anything to an email? We have new patient paperwork that you could fill out if you wanted to request [DURATION]. Oh, that would be great. Find it. Yeah. And then you can even find it online. But if you'd like, I can just grab your information, set you up proper online. Okay, yeah, yeahah. I'll go online and do all that. Yeah, perfect. And then I'll work on getting the stuff over to you from my current [OCCUPATION]. Okay, sounds like [DURATION] plan. Well, if you have any other questions please don't hesitate to give us [DURATION] call. Thank you. Have [DURATION] good day. You're welcome. You too. Bye now. Thank you. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. I can help you. Hi, It's [PERSON_NAME] with [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I am good. I'm reaching out in regards to mutual patient [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I got an email the other day asking just for letter from from us to you guys discussing. Let me see here. Notify them cleared for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. I wanted to see exactly what that was in regards to what [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is. Are you guys wanting clearance for. Let me and I'm sorry. Give me your name one more time. My name is [PERSON_NAME]. And you're with the part ofon's office or the. Yes, with [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. Let me see. I think they're probably just checking the status. Okay, so it looks like when he was here the other day he said that [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] said to go ahead with any kind of [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So we were just waiting to make sure that that was okay. Was that after [PERSON_NAME]? Do you know what kind of [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] it is exactly? I know that he needs [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for the molars that are missing on the right hand side. Is that the clearance you're needing or plan? I know all his [ORGANIZATION] stuff has already expired hold good. So he has several [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and several [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that needed to be done besides the [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. Okay. We just need to send another pre authorization because he's [ORGANIZATION] and then work on getting that approved. But we just want to make sure [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] first and see if y all can sen like a a letter of treatment. I think that there was a little bit of confusion because we still have aligners remaining. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] was G authorization to go ahead with for the missing teeth on the left hand side which would be twoth numbers 30 and 31 if necessary. So. But we still have some detailing and alignment to do with theigners that we have currently. So we have of course no aligners extending to 30 and 31. That's why we were giving the OK there. However, we still have some trays remaining that [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] on left and we have a rotation that we need for she number 29. Okay, so she still that a little bit to go then. Just a little bit. Yeah. I think there was some confusion there on what exactly was what he could go ahead and move forward with. [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] perfectly fine should he need those [MEDICAL_PROCESS] because that's not going to affect anything that we're doing. But anything that is current, the dentage currently there, we're still working with. Okay, perfect. I will let them know, and then that's perfect. We'll just kind of play about your for now. Okay, awesome. Thank you guys so much. Thanks. Have a great day. Bye."

[PERSON_NAME], this is. Hi. Do you offer overnight boarding for dogs? Yes, you do, ma'am. And do you have a room for new patients or new bog Just coming weekend. This weekend? Yes. Let me see. Do you have dates for me? Yes. So it would be the [DATE] through the [DATE]. Yes, it looks like we have room. But we will have to do an evaluation and we also will have to have you make a profile for your pup. Okay, so if you go to the [ORGANIZATION] website, you're going to hit book now and you're going to create an account for your pup and you're going to upload their vaccines and there's a health care agree that we need to to sign and then after that we can get you set up for that evaluation. Okay, and how much is it per [DURATION] [DURATION]. So how it works, if you would pay for your you would pay for the room. So we have the option between luxury and classes. Our luxury suite are [MONEY_AMOUNT] and our Plic Sueets are [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then on top of that you would pay for play time. Okay, and how much is play time? So we have three play time options. We have our $[MONEY_AMOUNT] option which is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION], so [DURATION] [DURATION] of play. And then we have a silver play time which is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. And you get extended checkout until [TIME] and then $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], which is our full care package, is [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] of stay, so [DURATION] [DURATION]. And you also receive a picture of your pup and you also get an extended checkout until [TIME] okay, and so if I'm getting back in town on Sunday, what time would I need to come pick her up? You just need to pick her out before [TIME] okay, so if I am coming into town to [LOCATION] and I just came to pick her up Monday morning instead, would I be charged like another [DURATION] [DURATION]? It depends what time on Monday you pick her up. Okay. Would I get a quote like once I fill it out on the website? Yeah, once you create that account, we can do a. We can make a reservation and at the end of that I can give you an estimate. Oay. And then you would like to that you just need to create the account. Okay, Ill ll go ahead and make an account. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Call back if you have any other questions. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION]. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. How may I help you? Hi there. I want to go ahead and get a reservation down. I might need to modify it, but I want to go ahead and get it on the book. And my dog's name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME], [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. And what is your last name? My last name is [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. I just want to make sure I have the right one. No, absolutely. If there's another [PERSON_NAME], I would not want that. Okay, and what kind of reservation would you like? So it's going to be overnight for quite a [DURATION] [DURATION]. Not [DURATION], but overnight. And when were you looking to book? So I would drop her [DATE] [DATE], which is a Sunday, and I would pick her up on [DATE], [DATE] [DATE]. Team. Okay, that has no problem. And could you remind me what's the most basic? I want to make sure she gets a ton of play time while I'm gone. That's always my goal. So what's the cheapest one for the overnight? Those packages, that would be our classic suite. Okay, can you. So sorry, can you. I forget I've done these things before. But can you explain again what they get with the basics? Yes, ma'am. So if you get the classic suite, you can still get a different package. The one that. Yes, it's more extensive, but they would get [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play. And that's the gold. Because with the bronze W is the cheapest one. They only get one play session. Ah, okay. Oh, no, that's okay. Okay, so classic is she gets the room. The classic is the. So aside from the play times, what's the classic itself? Then again, I always get this confused all the time. Yeah, that's just the room. It's just basic room. Okay. Oh, yeah, the other ones, they have like a patio or something. Is that right? Yes, ma'am. Okay. No, she's fine with the basic. Like get her classic. But then what is the difference in price for [DURATION] [DURATION] play versus one play, [DURATION] [DURATION]. Let me go back. Give me one second. No problem. Take the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I see he's been here before, correct? Yeah, many times. Okay. And I have even some credits on file, but they're the [DURATION] ones. So you're not the overnight. Sorry about that. No, take your time. I'm actually creating an online. So the silver, which they have the [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] play for the group is [MONEY_AMOUNT] on top of the room and that's [DURATION] [DURATION]. So like the classics, we have two $[MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT] and that's per [DURATION]. And then the gold is $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION]. But they get the extra potty break. They still get the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. Oh, to the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does the [MONEY_AMOUNT] does still give [DURATION] [DURATION]? Yes, ma'am. Okay, so the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION] and the [MONEY_AMOUNT] gives [DURATION] [DURATION]. But the [MONEY_AMOUNT] has a few other things, is that right? Yes, ma'am. [MONEY_AMOUNT] and those things. Sorry. Okay, go ahead. A progress report which is like pictures and updates on how their stay is. And that's about it. Okay. Okay, so. So [MONEY_AMOUNT] sil. That would probably be two. Okay, so if I did keep this for her to have all they play, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus the [MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then real quick, less than the [DURATION] [DURATION] play. What's the price for the T [DURATION]? Two play times or one playime? So the one play time would be $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Is there a [DURATION] [DURATION] times or. No, that would be the silver. Would they get [DURATION] [DURATION] play time or they can do [DURATION] [DURATION] play? It just. It depends. Oh, interesting. Okay, that's interesting. So basically if I was to do that, I'm looking at $[MONEY_AMOUNT] [DURATION] [DURATION], is that correct? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Oh my gosh. Adds up. And then if I want to add in the nail clippings, I can tell you that. Correct. Let me see if you want to add in a nail clipping. Trying to see did you want the [OCCUPATION]. Done? The nail trim? The actually might do the other one where they save it down really good. That would probably be the dremel. It's like where they rounded out. Okay. Yeah. How much is that one? That's $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. And then, and then the clipp thing is how much? [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Can you add that on there? Because I know for sure she needs your nails done. Yeah, of course. Did you want both of them or just a nail trim? So for the nail trim. It. It'it'it. Just makes they sharper. Is that what it is? They don't. They don't round it out? Yes, ma'am. They just clip them. They don't round them? No, you could do both. Go ahead and do [MONEY_AMOUNT] plus $[MONEY_AMOUNT]. And then my other question is how much is it? If the. How much fe is it? If she were to do some lessons? Do you have any less? I don't know if I want to do that. But do you have any lessons there that get added on? Any specials to get added on since it's still expensive? Let me see. So they would still be the same, like the same price O It wouldn't like give a discount or anything. It would just add on to the total at the end. Oh, okay. Okay. And then could you tell me what vaccine she's still in need of? Yes, ma'am. I had brought in paperwork to show she had one that was still good [DURATION] [DURATION] from the [OCCUPATION], but I don't know yet what would be the case. Yeah, of course. Did you want her to have like a.m. and p.m. play times or [DURATION] [DURATION]? Oh, definitely the [DURATION] [DURATION], yeah. Okay. And did you want that every [DURATION]? Every other [DURATION] I would put it. Let's put it down right now for every [DURATION]. Because my goal is that she so socialized this long time because she. She goes there, you know, she's obviously in the cloud, she with them. The problem though is that at home she's least reactive when I take her on walk. But at next [DURATION], you know, she does okay. Sometimes they bring her to the side, but you know, she's been able to be there [DURATION] [DURATION] when it comes to the playtime. And that's my goal is like to use this [DURATION] [DURATION] or of. For whatever long it is for her to be with dogs like the whole time. And I hope is it's gonna help her. Oh, I understand that. Give me one second. I'm trying to see about lodging. Okay. Sorry, I'm trying to reservation so I can check everything outse. Yeah, no problem. And you wanted to check on the vaccine? Yeah. What? God forbid. I got there, they're like, oh, she needs this and that. And then I'm like flying. I'm literally flying to [LOCATION]. Yeah, no, they're showing that they're all up to date. The only one that is about to expire is the [DRUG], which expires on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Awesome. I wouldn't you to get that before. Yes, ma'am. Okay, so border to. Are you guys doing any of the vaccine. You know, you guys do the vaccine thing in the parking lot? Yeah, they'll be here on the [DATE] from [TIME] to [TIME]. Okay, let me write that out on. Is it Sunday? Yes, ma'am. Okay. I'm gonna put that in here or to tell a Vacine. That way I have it and it's all done. Okay, that's. That's all. You know what time they're there on the [DATE]? [TIME] to [TIME] awesome. Okay. Is there anything else that I need to know right now? You don't charge the card or anything yet, right? In case I want to change this. Okay. I just want to'in there if you know if there's any special that [DURATION]. Like, I know I didn't do this, but it was [EVENT], I think. Like, you buy a pie, apple pie, something like. Is there any specials going on while she's there? I do not believe so, no, ma'am. But I think I'KNOW more around the time that she's coming in. Okay, that's good to know. Okay. All right. This is great. Thank you so much. I'm glad that I'm down. And then I. I'll circle back on anything I need to change. Yes, ma'am. And I have her down for the [DATE] through the [DATE]. Yeah. So my question actually is if I pick her up. I've done this before. Like, when I picked her up on the. Like, say that that Friday more. They didn't charge me for that Friday. If I did it by a certain time, they just charge me through Thursday. What's that time again? [TIME]. [TIME]. Okay, perfect. Okay, great. At least'save some money. Awesome. Okay, well, thank you so very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. You have a wonderful [DURATION]. You as well. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi. I wouldn just check in and to see what it would be to get my two dogs on like a [DRUG] [DRUG]. [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME]. Have we seen the pets before? Youve seen one of them, but not the other. Okay. What's your last [PERSON_NAME]? [PERSON_NAME] is [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] and the pets name_cy and we kind of like. I know that she may not sure that she's up to date on shop there, but we've been going other places and so we're just trying to get them on this since we're going to be out camping and things like that. Okay, let me look here. So in order to dispense any meds, we do have to do like a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. So that [MONEY_AMOUNT] and then the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] that we do prior to starting is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. So that would be just the exam and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], assuming that [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is current, which you said that you had elsewhere. And then medication wise. So there's a couple different options. There'a monthly chewable that will run. Let's see. So she's a lab, so probably around like $[MONEY_AMOUNT] a [DURATION]. Now you can buy it on a monthly basis or you can get like [DURATION] [DURATION] at a time, [DURATION] [DURATION] or [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. There is also an [MEDICAL_PROCESS] for [DRUG] [DRUG] that covers for [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION]. That one's a little bit. It costs about the same as doing like [DURATION] [DURATION] of the chewables, and it would kind of depend on how much they weighed. Okay. We'd probably do the twow of able. Okay. So I think she's around [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE] [PHYSICAL_ATTRIBUTE]. So you're saying that the exam would be like [MONEY_AMOUNT] for [PERSON_NAME] and then like, you know, [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT] [MONEY_AMOUNT], depending on how many months. If we got like [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] [DURATION] worth of those. Is that what we're. Yeah. Is the othero [PERSON_NAME]? No, [PERSON_NAME] passed away. So this one is [PERSON_NAME]. So she is a [NATIONALITY] shepherd. She just turned [PERSON_AGE]. All right. Because I have a [PERSON_NAME] and [PERSON_NAME], so I'll get that changed in our system as well. So yeah, it would be basically the exam, [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS], and then the chewables. As long as you bring in like [DRUG] [DRUG] history. Okay. And I'll have to double check. I don't. I mean, I don't think [PERSON_NAME] is up on her [MEDICAL_CONDITION]. So what would that cost if we needed to get that done? I think the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] is [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Yeah, it's [MONEY_AMOUNT]. Okay. Okay. All Right. O. So about. And that'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT] for both dogs for the exam and then the [MEDICAL_CONDITION] and then the [DRUG]. Right. It'd be about [MONEY_AMOUNT], [MONEY_AMOUNT] for the exam and the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. And then the [DRUG] would be additional. So, yeah, if you got like, let me look here because they're both probably the size range goes from [MONEY_AMOUNT] to [MONEY_AMOUNT]. I'm guessing they're both in there. So those are [MONEY_AMOUNT] per tablets. So per [DURATION]. Okay. Okay, perfect. Al rightty. Well, let me talk that over with my [MARITAL_STATUS] and I'll let you guys know. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. || Good afternoon. [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Hi, is this [PERSON_NAME]? No, this is [PERSON_NAME]. O Hi [PERSON_NAME].

Perfect. I saw yesterday told her she's going to have to start to get discounts to people. That's awesome. Ye. Go ahead. Okay. So the best email for them to send it to and then I'm just going to confirm that I spelled everything correct for your email because I want to make sure you get it correctly. I know you spelled it [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. [EMAIL_ADDRESS]. Yes. Okay, beautiful. So I am going to send you that email with those new patients information. I also ask if you can just take a picture of your insurance and send it to me because we do a complimentary insurance check before you come. You can just forward it to that email that I'm going to send to you as well. You just need like the insurance card with the. Exactly. Yeah. Because what company do you deal with man the insurance. Okay, perfect. Yeah. So I'm going to send this to you within the next [DURATION] [DURATION] if you want to just take a screenshot of and send it over to me if I'm missing anything. Of course I'll email you back to let you know. Okay, sounds good. Awesome. You'll have my email momentarily and then I will wait for those [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS] from your other office. When you do screenshot it just let me know if you have any issues with your other office and I will also call them to try to get them as well. Yeah, I don't think like. I mean I've been at this place for a long time, but actually Canyon closer to home anyway for me. So it. And it was the [LOCATION] location you were at, right? Yeah, [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay, perfect. Just so I have the right one just in case. Okay, awesome. I'll send you this off momentarily. We're looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday for that [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and check up with [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME]. Okay, great. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks [PERSON_NAME]. Have a wonderful [DURATION]. Yes, you as well. Bye now. Take care. Bye. || [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. This is [PERSON_NAME]. How can I direct your call? Hi, [PERSON_NAME]. I'm a new person calling. I've never called you guys. I just looked you up in our insurance and I'm calling. Great. My son, we're actually building a house in [LOCATION]. We live in [LOCATION] right now. But my son is coming home from college and he called and asked me to make him an appointment for a [MEDICAL_PROCESS] [MEDICAL_PROCESS]. But obviously he's not a patient. Ve so he's proably need an exam and whatnot. But he's only going to be here for the [DURATION] of the [DATE], and then he goes back to school for summer school. And I just want to know if you might have anything available while he's here the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. Well, he comes in on the [DATE], so he would have the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [DATE]. And he had two appointments. He needed a [OCCUPATION] and a [OCCUPATION] appointment for his ear. And I booked that at [TIME] on the [DATE]. But I can do anything else around that in the [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] or [DATE]. Sure, [PERSON_NAME], so we'd love to have you. We are booking out further than that, I think. But we can, if you like, put you on a waiting list and if something opens up, possibly get you sooner. Okay. What's your son's name? It's [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME]. [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] [PERSON_NAME] Is your name [PERSON_NAME]? I see it here on the caller idon y. I need to get you with our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION]. Her name is [PERSON_NAME] and she'left for the [DURATION], but I can have her give you a call back, if that's okay. Sure. Our office opens again Monday, so [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], so we could get you in, get you verified, and get you on that next available list. And pop_ibly get an appointment that early, but it would just depend on a lot. Okay, well, what do you think the chances are? Not that good, because I might just like when he's home, you know, for the holidays or something, maybe start a new thing. But he really needs a [MEDICAL_PROCESS], so I only have that. Otherwise he's not going toa be home again till probably the fall, so. So let me get you over to [PERSON_NAME]. I think she's already left, but. Yeah, she's already left. Well, she can call me and if it works out fine. But I might, you know, I might still have to call around if he's on a waiting list, because I only have that Window of time that he's here. Want that date that he's here. Said it's the [DURATION] of [DATE] [DATE]. He's going to be here the [DATE], the [DATE] to [DATE] and [DATE] because you guys are not open on the weekends. Right? Right. Okay. And then he had another [OCCUPATION] appointment that he needed. So I have the one appointment booked on the [DATE] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. But I have anything before that, around that, after that and the rest of the [DURATION], [DATE] may open wide open for him to come anytime he can get in. Okay. I'm writing all this down to give to her. And then is he just needing in for the checkup and [MEDICAL_PROCESS] or is there any like pain or any concerns and yeah, he doesn't have anything. He definitely hasn't been for [MEDICAL_PROCESS] since [MEDICAL_CONDITION] I'm sure being away at school he hasn't, but he has. Luckily we have a pretty. The genetics in our family are pretty good. I don't think are my kids have even had a [INJURY]. He had braces when he was in high school. Okay, so he just really wants the [MEDICAL_PROCESS] is all he's asking for. I mean obviously I know he needs to exam but I mean that'what he. That's the purpose, not because he's having a problem. Okay. Just so [MEDICAL_PROCESS] and is F number the correct number to call you back on? Yeah. And then like I said, I found you guys in our insurance and we are [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION]. Okay. I know we have lots of patients with [ORGANIZATION]. If you have the subscriber ID and group number handy, I can take that down too. Maybe make. I can get it if you can hold on. I don't have it in front of me, but I can get it. Yeah, absolutely. I'll hold in my wallet. Actually, you know what? I think I don't have it exact because we don't get a card for that. It's under our blue closs per shield. So would it be the same number? I don't have a separate card for [OCCUPATION] for [DRUG]. You don't get a card for that. Okay. I think you look it up by I mean I can give you the employer. I mean when I do like the vision the same thing. We don't have a card for that. Usually when I have patients that have [DRUG], they log into their app to get the subscriber group number. I'm not sure that it's the same card as I don't use the app for it, but I do have. I mean, I do have an ID number for [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] [ORGANIZATION] GroupW Shield and a group number and then the [OCCUPATION] coverages through that. You know, under that we don't have card I have for us. I'll take that down just in case it's a PPO. Okay, so the ID number, it's letters first. Okay, so [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Then [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Okay, so I have [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] no [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Perfect. Yep. And the group number is [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. What's after that? [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER] [HEALTHCARE_NUMBER]. Correct. Okay, I'm going to give all this information to our new [OCCUPATION] [OCCUPATION] and then she can give you a call Monday when our office opens back up. [PERSON_NAME]. All right. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Of course. Thank you."
